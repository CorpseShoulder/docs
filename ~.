# Device Passthrough - Overview


## Generic, fixed PCI Passthrough

VergeOS allows for generic PCI passthrough to provide one-to-one access to a physical PCI device, installed on a host server, by a single VM at a time.

## Mediated PCI Passthrough

VergeOS also supports various mediated PCI passthrough technologies that allow dissection of the physical PCI device into multiple virtual devices to then be accessed by multiple tenants/VMs simultaneously.  The following links can direct you to pages for particular passthrough methods: 

* nVidia vGPU
* SR-IOV - NICs
* USB device passthrough
