# How to Achieve Network Micro-Segmentation on VergeOS

Network micro-segmentation is a security approach that divides a network into isolated segments, each with its own security controls. This article explains how to implement micro-segmentation using VergeOS's powerful networking features.

## Key Features for Micro-Segmentation

VergeOS provides several features that enable effective network micro-segmentation:

1. **Internal Networks**: Create multiple isolated virtual networks.
2. **Network Rules**: Implement granular firewall rules.
3. **IPSec and WireGuard VPNs**: Establish encrypted tunnels between networks.
4. **Tenant Isolation**: Separate virtual data centers for strong multi-tenancy.
5. **Network Aliases**: Group IP addresses/networks for easier policy management.
6. **Port Mirroring**: Monitor traffic for security analysis.

## Implementing Micro-Segmentation

Follow these steps to achieve network micro-segmentation on VergeOS:

### 1. Design Your Network Topology

- Create separate internal networks for different applications or workloads.
- Each internal network provides a default-secure environment.

Example:
```
- Web Application Network
- Database Network
- Management Network
- Development Network
```

### 2. Configure Network Rules

Use network rules to control traffic between internal networks and VMs:

1. Navigate to the network dashboard.
2. Select "Rules" from the left menu.
3. Click "New" to create a rule.
4. Set the action (e.g., Accept, Drop), protocol, and direction.
5. Define source and destination networks/IPs.
6. Apply the rule.

Example rule: Allow web servers to access the database on a specific port:
```
Action: Accept
Protocol: TCP
Direction: Outgoing
Source: Web Application Network
Destination: Database Network
Destination Port: 3306
```

### 3. Utilize Network Aliases

Group IP addresses or networks for easier policy management:

1. Go to the network dashboard.
2. Select "Aliases" from the left menu.
3. Click "New" to create an alias.
4. Name the alias and add IP addresses or networks.
5. Use the alias in network rules.

Example:
```
Alias Name: Web Servers
IP Addresses: 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11, 192.168.1.12
```

### 4. Implement VPN Tunnels

For sensitive traffic between networks, use IPSec or WireGuard VPNs:

1. Navigate to the VPN configuration section.
2. Choose IPSec or WireGuard.
3. Configure the VPN settings (e.g., encryption, authentication).
4. Apply the VPN to the desired networks.

### 5. Leverage Tenant Isolation

For multi-tenant environments:

- Create separate tenants for different departments or customers.
- Each tenant has its own set of isolated internal networks.

### 6. Monitor and Adjust

Use port mirroring to monitor traffic:

1. Go to the network dashboard.
2. Enable port mirroring for the networks you want to monitor.
3. Analyze the traffic and adjust network rules as needed.

## Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege: only allow necessary traffic.
- Regularly review and update network rules.
- Use descriptive names for networks, rules, and aliases.
- Document your network topology and segmentation strategy.

By utilizing these features and following these steps, you can create a highly segmented network architecture on VergeOS, implementing zero trust principles and reducing the potential attack surface.
