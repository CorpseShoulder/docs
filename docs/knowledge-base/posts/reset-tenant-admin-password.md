# How to Reset a Tenant Administrative Password

If you need to change the administrative credentials for a tenant environment in your VergeOS system, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the VergeOS environment where the tenant is hosted.
2. Navigate to the **Tenant Dashboard** of the tenant for which you need to change the admin password.
3. In the **Tenant Dashboard**, click the **Edit** button in the left navigation menu. This will open the Tenant Edit screen.
4. In the Tenant Edit screen, type the new password in the **Admin User Password** field.
5. Re-enter the password in the **Confirm Admin User Password** field.
6. After entering the same password in both fields, click **Submit**. If the passwords do not match, an error message will appear.
7. After successfully updating the admin password, open a web browser and navigate to the tenant environment where the password was changed.
8. Log in as the admin. The username will be **admin** and the password will be the new password you saved in step 6.
