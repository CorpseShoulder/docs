## How to Reset a Tenant Administrative Password

If you need to change the administrative credentials to a tenant environment underneath your current VeregOS environment, you can easily accomplish this task by completing the following steps:

1. Login to the VeregOS environment where the tenant is hosted.
1. Once inside navigate to the Tenant Dashboard section of the tenant for which you need to change the admin password.
1. At that Tenant Dashboard, click the Edit button in the left navigation menu. This will launch the Tenant Edit screen.
1. In the new screen, type a new password to use in the field labeled: Admin User Password
1. Type in the same password in the field labeled: Confirm Admin User Password
1. After entering the same password in both locations, click Submit. If the passwords did not match in both fields, an error message will appear.
1. After successfully updating the admin password for the tenant, using a web browser, navigate to the tenant environment where the password was just changed.
1. Login as the admin to this system.  The user name will be: admin and the password will be the new password you saved in step #6.
