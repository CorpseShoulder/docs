<h1>Configuring the Sites Dashboard (Adding Sites)</h1>
<p>Each site that is added to the Sites Dashboard can be included with various options: sync (incoming and/or outgoing), statistics monitoring, machine management, and repair server (incoming and/or outgoing).</p>
<h3>To Add a Site to the Dashboard</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Main Dashboard, Click <strong>Sites</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>New Site</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li>Enter a <i><strong>Name</strong></i> that clearly identifies the system, such as a location description.</li>
  <li>Enter the <i><strong>URL</strong></i> to reach the system, Ex: https://Chicago-verge.abcco.com) (URL must be reachable from this Verge.io system)</li>
  <li><i><strong>Allow Insecure SSL Connection</strong></i> will permit site connections without a valid CA-signed certificate (e.g. missing, invalid, expired, or self-signed certs). <strong>NOTE: This option is NOT intended for normal use; it should only be selected in cases where site connections are secure (e.g. behind a common firewall, connected via private lines), or for short durations to troubleshoot initial connection issues.</strong></li>
  <li>Enter <i><strong>User</strong></i> of the remote system. (admin-level user required).</li>
  <li>Enter the <i><strong>Password</strong></i> for the user entered above.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Cloud Snapshots</strong></i>:<br>(system-to-system transfer of cloud snapshots to facilitate data archiving, DR, etc.; also referred to as <strong>site sync</strong>.)<ul>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - does not configure snapshot sync between these systems</li>
      <li><strong>Send cloud snapshots to this site</strong> - *auto creates outgoing sync on this system and incoming sync on the other side to allow transferring snapshots from this system to the remote one</li>
      <li><strong>Receive cloud snapshots from this site</strong> - *auto creates incoming sync on this system and outgoing sync on the other side to allow transferring snapshots from the remote system to this one.</li>
      <li><strong>Send and receive cloud snapshots from this site</strong> - *auto creates incoming and outgoing syncs on both sides to facilitate snapshot transfer both ways</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Sync Statistics</strong></i>:<br>(continual status information transfer between sites, for simpler monitoring of multiple Verge.io systems: displays high-level status info for each site with the ability to drill down on a specific site for more detailed information)<ul>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - does not configure statistics transfer between these systems</li>
      <li><strong>Send statistics to this site</strong> - will send statistics from this system to the remote one</li>
      <li><strong>Receive statistics from this site</strong> - will send statistics from the remote system to this one</li>
      <li><strong>Send and receive statistics from this site</strong> - will send local statistics to the remote system and from the remote system to this one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Machine Management</strong></i>:<br>(allows power on/power off, reset and kill power of VMs from the site dashboard)</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note: sync statistics must be configured (above) to allow machine management.</i></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - does not configure remote machine management between the systems</li>
  <li><strong>Manage this site's machines</strong> - allows management of the other system's VMs to be performed from this system</li>
  <li><strong>This site can manage my machines</strong> allows management of this local system's VMs from the other system</li>
  <li><strong>Allow bi-directional management of machines</strong> - allows management of both systems's VMs from the other</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><i><strong>Repair Server</strong></i>:<br>(automatic potential rehabilitation if a system experiences problems extending its redundancy tolerance (such as multiple, simultaneous drive failures across nodes), typically, repair server would be a sync destination that contains a relatively recent replication of the given system.) More information about repair servers can be found here: <a href="https://yottadoc.ro.verge.io/#help?id=sitesyncs-repair">Repair Server</a>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - does not configure repair servers between these systems</li>
      <li><strong>Connect to this site for repairs</strong> - configures the remote site as a repair server for the local system</li>
      <li><strong>Receive connections from this site for repairs</strong> - configures local system as a repair server for the remote site</li>
      <li><strong>Enable bi-directional repair servers</strong> - configures both systems to provide repairs for the other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> (bottom of page) to finish adding the site.</li>
</ol>
