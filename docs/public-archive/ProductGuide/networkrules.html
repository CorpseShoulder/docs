<h1>Network Rules</h1>
<p>Rules define behavior for incoming and outgoing traffic in a network, providing the functionality traditionally provided by firewalls, routers, and switches.</p>
<h3>Rule Types:</h3>
<h3>Order of Rules</h3>
<p>Rules are processed from the top of list to the bottom. There are situations where the order in which rules are processed can change behavior (As an example: a NAT/PAT rule to translate incoming traffic to a different port, while another rule that blocks traffic based on port; there could be different results depending upon which rule runs before the other.) Therefore, it may be important to consider the order of your network rules. See the instructions below to Change the Order of Rules.</p>
<h3>How-to Quick Reference</h3>
<h3>Note: Rules are accessed from the particular Network Dashboard. To Access a Network Dashboard:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Cloud dashboard, click <strong>Networks</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>All Networks</strong> quick-link box in the top count area.</li>
  <li><strong>Double-click </strong>the desired <strong>Network</strong> in the list.</li>
</ol>
<h3>View Existing Rules for a Network</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Network Dashboard, click <strong>Rules</strong>. All existing rules for the network are listed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a New Firewall Rule (to explicitly allow or deny particular traffic)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Network Dashboard, click <strong>Rules</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>New</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li>Enter a <i><strong>Name</strong></i> for the new rule. (Name should be something helpful for future administration.)</li>
  <li>Select Accept/Drop/Reject from the <i><strong>Action</strong></i> dropdown list.<ul>
      <li><strong>Accept</strong> - allow packets through that meet the defined criteria</li>
      <li><strong>Drop</strong> - do not allow packets that meet the defined criteria</li>
      <li><strong>Reject</strong> - do not allow specified traffic and send ICMP destination unreachable back to the source, when permitted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Protocol</strong></i> from the dropdown list. (<strong>ANY</strong> option will apply this rule to all protocols.)</li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Direction</strong></i> from the dropdown list. (Incoming or Outgoing)</li>
  <li>The <i><strong>Track Rule Statistics</strong></i> checkbox can be selected to amass totals of the traffic that is processed through this rule. See <a href="https://yottadoc.ro.verge.io/#help?id=net-tracking">Tracking Network Statistics</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Source</strong></i> (where traffic comes from) and <i><strong>Destination</strong></i> (where traffic is addressed to go) from the dropdown list.<ul>
      <li><strong>Alias </strong>- to select an Alias IP defined on this network.</li>
      <li><strong>Any/None</strong> - any source address; no filter on source address</li>
      <li><strong>Custom*</strong> - provides a text input field where a specific filter can be entered. Custom entries can include individual IP address(ex: 192.168.1.200), CIDR network(ex: 10.10.4.0/28), or IP range(ex: 192.168.1.50-192.168.1.100)</li>
      <li><strong>My IP Addresses</strong> - to select an IP address defined on this network (from virtual IPs, static IPs, IP Aliases)</li>
      <li><strong>Default</strong> -(destination/route rule) - defines default route</li>
      <li><strong>My Network Address</strong> - to use this network (entire segment)</li>
      <li><strong>My Router IP</strong> - to use this network's IP address (single IP address)</li>
      <li><strong>Other IP Address</strong> - to select a different network and one of that network's particular addresses</li>
      <li><strong>Other Network Address </strong>- to select a different network and use that network's address (entire segment).</li>
      <li><strong>Other Router IP</strong> - to select a different network and use that network's IP address (single IP address).</li>
      <li><strong>Other Network DMZ IP</strong> - to select the DMZ IP address of another network.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the new rule.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Select <i><strong>Action</strong></i> from the dropdown list.<ul>
      <li><strong>Route</strong> - to define a routing rule</li>
      <li><strong>Translate</strong> - to define a rule that maps an address/port outside of this network with an address/port within this network</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Protocol</strong></i> from the dropdown list to apply this rule only to specific protocols. Select <strong>ANY</strong> to apply this rule to all protocols)</li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Direction</strong></i> from the dropdown list. Incoming(to this network)/Outgoing(from this network)</li>
  <li>The <i><strong>Track Rule Statistics</strong></i> checkbox can be selected to amass totals of the traffic that is processed through this rule. See <a href="https://yottadoc.ro.verge.io/#help?id=net-tracking">Tracking Network Statistics</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Source</strong></i> (where traffic comes from), <i><strong>Destination</strong></i> (where traffic is addressed to go) , and <i><strong>Target (where to actually direct the traffic)</strong></i>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alias</strong> - to select an Alias IP defined on this network.</li>
      <li><strong>Any/None</strong> - any source address; no filter on source address</li>
      <li><strong>Default</strong> - (destination/route rule) - defines default route</li>
      <li><strong>Custom*</strong> - provides a text input field where a specific filter can be entered (individual IP address; CIDR network, IP range) ex: 192.168.0.55; 10.10.10.0/24; 192.168.0.20-192.168.0.30</li>
      <li><strong>My IP Addresses</strong> - to select an IP address defined on this network (from virtual IPs, static IPs, IP Aliases)</li>

  <li>Specify <i><strong>Source/Destination/Target Ports/Ranges</strong></i> (only applies to TCP/UDP protocols). Ports can be individual ports (with multiple individual ports separated by commas ex: 8080,8088) and port ranges ex: 1000-1005</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the new rule.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a New Rule Based on an Existing Rule</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Network Dashboard, click <strong>Rules</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Select the rule</strong> from the list and click the <strong>(copy icon</strong>) on the far right of the selected line.</li>
  <li>The new rule <i><strong>Name</strong></i> will default to the name of the source rule with "(copy)" appended to the end. Change the name to something helpful for future administration.</li>
  <li>Fields are pre-populated with the values of the source rule, <strong>alter as needed</strong> for the new rule.</li>
  <li>When fields are changed as needed, click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the new rule.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Modify Existing Network Rule</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Network Dashboard, click <strong>Rules</strong>.</li>

  <li>Make changes and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply Rules</strong> on the left menu to put the change into effect.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pin a Firewall Rule to the Top or Bottom</h3>
<p><i>Rule processing order: top to bottom</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>Network Dashboard</strong>, click <strong>Rules</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Select the rule</strong> to pin.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> on the left.</li>

  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the change.<ul>
      <li>A right-side-up pin icon indicates the rule is pinned to the top.</li>
      <li>An upside-down pin icon indicates the rule is pinned to the bottom.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Change the Order of Rules</h3>
<p><i>rule processing order: top to bottom</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>Network Dashboard</strong>, click <strong>Rules</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the rule(s) to move up in the list. (Make sure the desired rules are checked on the left.)</li>
  <li>Determine the rule the selected ones should be moved above (meaning the selected rules should execute before this one) and click the <strong>(move icon) </strong>on that line. The selected rules are moved up the list.</li>
  <li>Continue this process until all are in the desired sequence.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply Rules</strong> on the left menu to put the changes into effect.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note: Rule changes are applied after Applying Rules (from the left menu option) or otherwise, the next time the network is restarted.</i></p>
