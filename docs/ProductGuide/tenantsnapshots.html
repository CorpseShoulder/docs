<h1>Tenant Snapshots</h1>
<p>Snapshots provide a way to obtain quick recovery points. Cloud snapshots allow for a complete rollback of a system (to the point in time of a snapshot) to protect in the event of major unforeseen issues that may arise. A cloud snapshot includes whole-system snapshots for each tenant as well. A tenant can be allowed (a per-tenant setting) to browse a listing of available provider snapshots and “self-serve” download selected timestamps to restore their entire system or individual VMs.</p>
<p><i>Tenants also have the ability to manage their own Verge.io snapshots within their system; this can allow a tenant to customize scheduling/retention as they wish. (Note: Tenant will need adequate provisioned storage to retain snapshots.)</i></p>

  <li>Click <strong>Cloud Snapshots</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Select the desired provider snapshot from the list of available timestamps.</strong>
    <ul>

However, if there currently is a VM with the same name (e.g. the original VM still exists,) the VM name will need to be changed before it can be recovered.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
