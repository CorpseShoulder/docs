<h1>Reducing a Tenant's Resources</h1>
<p>Tenant compute resources can be reduced on-the-fly, by deleting a tenant node or reducing the cores/RAM assigned to tenant nodes.</p>
<h4>Reducing cores/RAM provisioned to a Tenant Node</h4>
<p>The tenant node does not need to be powered off to reduce resource settings; however, if those resources are currently in use by tenant workloads, they will not actually be reclaimed until VMs are shut down. Example: if you reduce a tenant node's RAM resources to 28GB while 32GB is in use by its VMs; the change can be made, but it does not automatically shut down or reclaim any RAM from running VMs.</p>
<h4>Deleting a Tenant Node</h4>
<p>In order to delete a tenant node, it must first be powered off. Do not delete the original tenant node; each tenant needs at least one node.</p>
<h3>To Delete a Tenant Node</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>tenant dashboard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Nodes</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Double-click the desired node</strong> in the list.</li>
  <li><strong>If needed, migrate or power off VMs and Power off</strong> the node, then return to the tenant node list. (Use the browser back button or the "Tenant Nodes" breadcrumb.)</li>
  <li><strong>Select</strong> the <strong>node</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Delete</strong> on the left menu.</li>
</ol>
