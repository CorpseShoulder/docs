# Requesting an Airgap License from Verge

VergeOS requires a valid license for operation. For systems in airgapped environments, you need to request a special airgap license. This guide will walk you through the process of requesting an airgap license from Verge.

## Steps to Request an Airgap License

  *   From the VergeOS UI Home, click System on the left menu
  *   Click Settings on the left menu. The Settings page appears
  *   In the License section, click the Request License button
  *   A popup window titled "Request Generated" will appear, displaying information about the license request file
  *   Click the Download Request File button to save the license request file to your local machine

!!! note "Click the Email license@verge.io button to open your default email client with a pre-addressed email to Verge.io's licensing team"

The popup will show:

  *   The name of the generated license request file
  *   Instructions to download and email the file to license@verge.io

Attach the downloaded license request file to the email.
Provide any additional information required in the email body, such as your company name and the purpose of the license.
Send the email to Verge's licensing team.

## What Happens Next

Verge.io's licensing team will process your request and generate an airgap license file.
You will receive a reply email with the airgap license file attached.
Once you receive the license file, you'll need to upload it to your VergeOS system. (This process is covered in a separate guide.)


Note: The turnaround time for license requests may vary. If you haven't received a response within 2 business days, please follow up with Verge's support team.

## Important Considerations

Ensure that the system requesting the license is the one you intend to license. The generated request is specific to the system hardware.
Keep the license request file secure, as it contains information about your system.
If you need to request licenses for multiple systems, repeat this process for each system individually.
