- Number of VMs: 96

### Compute Requirements

- Current CPU utilization: [Insert average CPU utilization]
- Expected growth: 10% annually

These requirements will guide our design decisions for the new VergeOS deployment.

## Architecture Overview

Our reference architecture consists of two main sites: Headquarters (HQ) and Disaster Recovery (DR). Each site is designed with redundancy and performance in mind, utilizing VergeOS's capabilities to create a robust and flexible environment.

### HQ Site Configuration

- 2 Metadata Nodes
- 3 Non-Metadata Nodes

### DR Site Configuration

- 2 Metadata Nodes
- 1 Non-Metadata Node

This setup provides a balance of performance, redundancy, and cost-effectiveness across both sites, while also allowing for future expansion.

## Hardware Specifications

Let's break down the hardware specifications for each node type:

### Controller/Metadata Nodes (HQ and DR)

- CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6442Y (2.6GHz, 24C/48T)
- Memory: 28 x 64GB (1792GB total)
- HBA connected Storage:
  - 2 x 800GB NVMe (Tier 0) - Only required in node 1 and 2
  - 8 x 3.84TB SSD (Capacity)
  - 1 x 3.84TB SSD (Hot Spare)
- Network: 4 x Dual Port 10/25GbE

### Non-Controller/Metadata Nodes (HQ and DR)

- CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6442Y (2.6GHz, 24C/48T)
- Memory: 28 x 64GB (1792GB total)
- HBA connected Storage:
  - 8 x 3.84TB SSD (Capacity)
  - 1 x 3.84TB SSD (Hot Spare)
- Network: 4 x Dual Port 10/25GbE

These specifications ensure high performance, ample storage, and robust networking capabilities across all nodes.

### Capacity Planning

- Total Raw Metadata Storage: 
  - HQ: (2 * 2 * 800GB) = ~700GB
  - DR: (2 * 2 * 800GB) = ~700GB
- Total Raw Workload Storage: 
  - HQ: (2 * 2 * 800GB) + (5 * 8 * 3.84TB) = 156.8TB
  - DR: (2 * 2 * 800GB) + (3 * 8 * 3.84TB) = 95.2TB
- Total Usable Storage (estimated): ~70TB (considering data block redundancy, hot spares, and overhead)
- Total Memory: 
  - HQ: 5 * 1536GB = 7680GB (7.5TB)
  - DR: 3 * 1536GB = 4608GB (4.5TB)

This configuration exceeds the current requirements (40TB storage, 3.4TB memory) and provides room for the expected 10% annual growth.

## Storage Configuration

VergeOS leverages a tiered storage approach for optimal performance and capacity:

### Tier 0 (High Performance)

- 800GB NVMe drives
- Used for high-performance workloads and caching

### Capacity Tier

- 3.84TB SSD vSAS Mixed Use drives
- 3DWPD (Drive Writes Per Day) for enhanced endurance
- Ideal for general VM storage and data

### Hot Spare

- 1 x 3.84TB SSD per node for automatic replacement of failed drives

This configuration provides a balance of performance and capacity, with built-in redundancy for data protection.

## Network Design

The network design is crucial for ensuring high availability and performance:

### Core Network

- Dedicated 25GbE network for VergeOS internal communication
- Jumbo frames enabled (MTU 9000+)
- Redundant switches for high availability

### External Network

- 10GbE connectivity for VM and user traffic
- VLANs for traffic segregation

### Storage Network

- 32Gb Fibre Channel for high-speed storage access
- Redundant fabric for fault tolerance

This design ensures low-latency communication between nodes, high-bandwidth access to storage, and reliable connectivity for VMs and users.

## Multi-Tenancy Design

VergeOS's multi-tenancy capabilities allow for efficient resource allocation and isolation:

### Tenant 1: HQ General Workloads

- Allocated resources for non-critical VMs and general operations

### Tenant 2: HQ Critical Workloads

- Dedicated resources for 8 critical VMs
- Total provisioned space: ~4TB
- Total RAM allocation: 216GB

### Tenant 3: DR Site Replicated Workloads

- Resources allocated for critical VMs replicated from HQ to DR

This design ensures proper isolation and resource guarantees for different workload types and criticality levels.

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

VergeOS provides robust HA and DR capabilities:

### High Availability

- Multiple nodes per site for redundancy
- Automated failover for VMs in case of node failure

### Disaster Recovery

- Site-to-site replication for critical VMs
- VergeOS Site Sync for efficient data transfer
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) tailored to business needs

These features ensure business continuity in the face of both localized failures and site-wide disasters.

## Scalability and Growth

The architecture is designed to accommodate future growth:

- 10% annual growth capacity built into initial sizing
- Easy addition of non-metadata nodes for horizontal scaling
- Ability to upgrade components (CPU, RAM, storage) for vertical scaling

This flexibility allows the infrastructure to evolve with the organization's needs.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've explored a comprehensive reference architecture for deploying VergeOS in an enterprise multi-site scenario. By leveraging VergeOS's powerful features and following these design principles, organizations can create a robust, scalable, and efficient infrastructure that meets the demands of modern business operations.

This architecture not only meets the current requirements of 40TB storage and 3.4TB memory allocation for 96 VMs but also provides ample room for the expected 10% annual growth. The transition from the current 5-node architecture to this expanded and optimized setup will significantly enhance performance, reliability, and scalability.

### Next steps

- Engage with VergeOS support for detailed implementation planning
- Conduct a proof of concept to validate the architecture in your environment
- Develop a migration strategy for existing workloads to the new VergeOS infrastructure
- Plan the decommissioning of the current 5-node architecture

By following this reference architecture and leveraging VergeOS's capabilities, you're well-positioned to create a resilient, high-performance infrastructure that can support your enterprise's critical workloads and future growth.
