<p>What are the requirements for encrypting the vSAN?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is my data encrypted at Rest? How can I verify if my system is using encryption for the vSAN?<ul>
      <li>You can confirm this by navigating to Nodes&gt;Node 1&gt; Drives and then double-clicking on the first drive in the list.&nbsp; There is a checkbox for encryption.&nbsp; If it is encrypted, it will be checked.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>My drives are not encrypted, can I change that after the system has been installed?<ul>
      <li>Unfortunately, encryption for the vSAN is configured during the initial installation only</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>My system has encryption configured, how does the <a href="http://verge.io/">Verge.io</a> system start on an encrypted system?</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>The most common method is by having encryption keys written to a usb drive during the initial installation.&nbsp; In this scenario,&nbsp; these drives are typically plugged in to the first two nodes of an encrypted system to boot normally.&nbsp; All other nodes do not require them,&nbsp; as node 1 and node 2 are the controller nodes.&nbsp; The usb drive does not require much storage at all, less than 1GB.</li>
  <li>If the controller nodes do not have usb encryption keys connected, the <a href="http://verge.io/">Verge.io</a> system will prompt an operator to type the proper encryption password to complete the power up off the <a href="http://verge.io/">Verge.io</a> system.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Is my data encrypted in flight?&nbsp; Is my data encrypted through the site-sync transfer?<ul>
      <li>Yes, by default encryption is set for all snapshot synchronizations through a site-sync.&nbsp; Information about encrypting a Site Synchronization can be found in the inline help within the category titled, Site Syncs, under the section labeled 'Creating Outgoing Sync.'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
