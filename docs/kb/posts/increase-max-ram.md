## Max RAM per machine setting explained
The Max RAM per machine setting determines the maximum amount of RAM a virtual machine can own on a particular cluster. The setting prevents a user from maliciously using all available memory on a cluster node. 

At install time the default max RAM setting is 64GB. In order to run a virtual machine that is larger than 64GB this setting must be changed post install. The setting can be changed run time meaning **a node reboot is not required to apply the setting**.
 
If a machine that has more RAM allocated than allowed tries to start a "**Machine exceeds the max amount of ram allowed on this cluster**" error will be logged. The setting must be adjusted to accomdate for the large workload.
