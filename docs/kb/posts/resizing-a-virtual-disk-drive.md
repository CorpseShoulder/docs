## How to Resize a Disk Drive Inside a Virtual Machine


Information about resizing a particular VM disk drive can be found in the inline help within the category titled, Virtual Machines, under the section labeled **'Modify a VM Drive'**.

**Some items of note:**
> **NOTE:** If the VM configuration is set to allow hot-plugging, the disk interface is set to 'Virtio-SCSI' and the guest Operating System (OS) supports it, drive size usually can be added without power cycling the VM.

> **WARNING:** Drives cannot be reduced in size. (Inside the guest OS, Partitions may be able to be resized but not drives.)
> {.is-danger}

> **WARNING:** Modifications to drive size will most likely require corresponding modifications within the guest Operating System to use the newly created space.
