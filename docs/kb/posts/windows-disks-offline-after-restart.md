## How to Correct Disks showing Offline after a Windows VM is Restarted
After importing a VM into the VergeIO platform, some (virtual) disks may not come online after a restart of the guest VM.

Beginning in Windows 2008, Microsoft added a setting for the default state of additional (non OS) disk drives.
Occasionally when restarting, Windows may detect a hardware change, which is more likely if the VM was imported from an alternate hypervisor.
When windows detects a hardware change, it may not bring secondary virtual disks online automatically.
To change this to the recommended setting run the following Windows PowerShell:

`Set-StorageSetting -NewDiskPolicy OnlineAll`

Additionally, this can be done from the command line using diskpart or from Disk Management.
