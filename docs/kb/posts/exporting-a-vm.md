### Exporting VMs from VergeIO

1. Login into the VergeIO platform and navigate to the **dashboard of the virtual machine** that you'd like to export.
1. On the left, click on **Drives** to open a **list view** of the virtual disk drives attached to **this VM**.
1. Select **a drive** and choose '**Download**' on the left.  This will download the drive as a **.raw** format, which is supported by most current hypervisors.
1. The system will begin downloading the disk image using the **default settings of your web browser**.
1. Once the drive has been downloaded, **consult with documentation for the new hypervisor** on best practices for uploading/importing/converting .raw disk image types.
