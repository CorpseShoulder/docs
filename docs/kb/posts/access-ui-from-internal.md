## How to Set Up an Internal UI Route

Sometimes, you may need to access the User Interface (UI) from a virtual machine (VM) within a VergeIO environment. To achieve this, you need to create a special route rule on the network (usually an internal network) to which the VM is connected.

### Steps to Create the Route Rule

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**: Go to the dashboard of the network that your VM is connected to.

2. **Create a New Rule**: Create a new rule using the settings shown in the example below:

3. **Submit the Rule**: Submit the rule. You will be taken back to the list view of the rules on the network.

4. **Select and Apply the Rule**: Select the newly created rule, which will be highlighted, and apply it.

5. **Access the UI from the VM**: Open a web browser within the VM and navigate to the IP address of the network router, for example: `https://192.168.4.1`.
