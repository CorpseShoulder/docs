## After restoring a copy of a virtual machine from a recent snapshot, the restored copy may fail to boot properly.
The VM may stop with a blue screen message which reads: 
- `Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.  We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you.`

There are several reasons at the guest level that can cause a VM running Windows to not start successfully.
The most common issue is generally because the snapshot was not taken in a clean (**Quiesced**) state and usually the result of the Microsoft Windows Update service partially installing update packages.

**Best Practice:**
A guest VM running a Windows OS, and experiencing an unexpected restart is often found to be caused by the Microsoft Windows Update Services being configured to automatically apply updates that frequently require a restart.  To investigate this further, consult with published Knowledge-Base articles about your particular version of Windows. One of the best places to start investigating at a Windows Guest level is using Windows Event Viewer application and reviewing the Windows Update logs for more information.
