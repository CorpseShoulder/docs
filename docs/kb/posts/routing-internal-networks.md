## How to Configure Routing Between Networks

The following is a simple method to establish a route between two networks in the VergeIO platform. 
<br>
### Create a network rule on the first network to route traffic to the second network
1. Navigate to the first network that you would like to be able to reach the other network.
1. From that network dashboard, on the left navigation menu, click on **Rules**.
1. In the Rules menu, on the left navigation menu, click on **New** to create a new network rule.
1. The following settings should be configured for this rule:
   - Under Rule
      - Name: *Something to indicate this rule is a route to the second network.*
      - Action: Route
      - Protocol: Any
      - Direction Outgoing
   - Under Source
      - Type: My Network Address
   - Under Destination
      - Type: Other Network Address
