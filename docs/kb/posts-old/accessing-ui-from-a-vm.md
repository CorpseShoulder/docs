## How to access the VergeIO UI from within a VM that is running inside the platform

In networking terminology, this is commonly known as hair-pinning, which can be defined as: the method where a packet travels to an interface, goes out towards the Internet but instead of continuing, it makes a ‚Äúhairpin turn‚Äù, and comes back in on the same interface.

### Create a new rule on the internal network that the VM is currently connected to. 

- Under **Rule** make sure to set the following values:
   - Name: Should be something for reference, such as **Access UI**
   - Action: Translate
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Direction: Incoming 
- Under **Source** leave the default settings.
- Under **Destination** set the following values:
   - Type: My Network Addresses
   - Destination Ports/Ranges: 80,443
- Under **Target** set the following values:
   - Type: Other Network DMZ IP
   - Target Network: Core
- Click **Submit** to save this rule. This change will also require **Apply Rules** to apply this new rule to the running network.

From inside the VM that a user wishes to access the UI from, use a web browser to navigate to the IP address of this network, rather than the standard address.  For example, if the internal network has an IP address of 192.168.0.1, use this address to access the VergeIO platform.
