<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Last Updated July 2019</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>The Yottabyte VMware feature provides a direct interface with vSphere (storage independent) to run a backup agent for VMware virtual machines. &nbsp; The Yottabyte agent initiates snapshots, with the ability to access both full and incremental backups for either a one-time import into Yottabyte or ongoing backup and DR for vSphere environments.</p>
<h2><strong>Setting up VMware Backups - High level Steps</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create a VMware Service</strong> (This creates a direct connection to the vSphere environment.)</li>
  <li><strong>Create Schedule(s).</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Assign Schedules to VMs </strong>(different schedules can be assigned to different VMs.)</li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1><strong>Creating a VMware Service</strong></h1>
<p>The first step to creating a backup/import of VMware VMs to Yottabyte is to create a VMware Service.&nbsp; The VMware service establishes a direct agent connection with vSphere; network access and admin login credentials to the vSphere environment are required.</p>
<h2><strong>To Create a New VMware Service:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>Main Dashboard</strong>, click <strong>Backup/DR.</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>VMware</strong> on the left menu. (Any existing VMware Services will appear in the list view.)</li>
  <li>Click <strong>New</strong> on the left menu.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:594px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3j3LD8P5masjN-7wmYoK_msKbH0idkWUvmAxuK4AM9MA1fL3jXQAYUPQx1hUzbuZQzysusArYC05o1pWm5qIOlhNhiairXRfaj0N-OcwbmO5iCRJOEmYQ22-OUAgg-7KeyfBtbYBAnHeJd0lzYaUcw"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VMware Service Settings:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> for the VMware service (required).</li>
  <li>Typically, it is recommended to keep the <strong>2 cores </strong>and <strong>2GB RAM</strong> <strong>default </strong>settings in place; this will be suitable for almost all situations.</li>
  <li><strong>Optionally</strong>, a specific <strong>Cluster</strong> can be selected (or leave as -- Default--).</li>
  <li><strong>Optionally</strong>, a <strong>Failover Cluster</strong> can be selected (or leave as --Default--).</li>
  <li><strong>Optionally</strong>, a <strong>Preferred Node</strong> can be selected on which to run this service (or leave as --None-- for the system to select Node.)</li>
  <li><strong>Optionally</strong>, enter a <strong>Description</strong> to record additional information, if desired.</li>
  <li>Select desired<strong> On Power Loss </strong>setting<strong>:&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><i><strong>Last State</strong></i> - Service&nbsp; will only be powered on if it was on at the time of power loss.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Leave Off </strong></i>- Service will not be powered on when power is restored (regardless of its state at time of power loss).</li>
  <li><i><strong>Power On</strong></i> - Service will be powered on when power is restored (regardless of its state at time of power loss).</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Select a <strong>Network</strong> on which to run the VMware service.&nbsp; <strong>Note: </strong>DHCP required on selected network.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>vSphere Settings:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the <strong>vSphere DNS or IP </strong>(required).&nbsp; Address should be reachable from the network selected for the service (above)..&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><i><strong>Note: It is recommended to connect to the vSphere cluster rather than an individual ESX(i) node.&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<ol>
  <li>The default <strong>vSphere Port</strong> is <i><strong>443</strong></i>; this is the typical listening port for vmware client connections.&nbsp; Change to alternate port if needed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>vSphere Use</strong>r name.</li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>vSphere Password </strong>for the above user<strong>.</strong></li>
  <li>The <strong>Allow Insecure Certificates</strong> option can be selected if the vSphere address is not using a certificate signed by a certificate authority (e.g. self-signed certificates).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the new service.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You are returned to the VMware Services listing where the new service will appear.&nbsp; <strong>Click the Service</strong> to select it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Power On</strong> on the left menu to start the service and attempt connection to vSphere.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the service is started, <strong>double click to bring up the VMWare Service Dashboard.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Modify Advanced vSphere Settings(OPTIONAL) :</strong></p>
<p>Once the service is&nbsp; powered on, advanced vSphere settings can be changed, if desired.&nbsp; Note: default settings will be appropriate for most installations.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Edit</strong> on the left menu.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Max Concurrent VM backups - the number of simultaneous VMware backups.&nbsp; The default setting (4) is typically appropriate; however, this number can be increased to speed backup processes from Vsphere systems with high CPU resources and adequate available bandwidth.&nbsp; Conversely, this setting can be reduced for systems with lower CPU resources/lower available bandwidth. &nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Name for the auto-created snapshot during backup - the name given to the temporary, VMware-created snapshot used during the backup operation. (default = “yb_backup”)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Default VM backup schedule - defines the backup schedule to be assigned automatically to all new VMware VMS discovered by the service.&nbsp; Initially this is set to&nbsp; --None-, which will set new VMs to use no Schedule (no backups) by default.&nbsp; After Schedules are created, the default can be changed in order to assign a specific backup schedule to any newly detected VMs. See section:&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxTQWFym6l3eaiuxFHST4mriX52zEXCmRBD7kRfoB7I/edit#bookmark=id.tvqw42pxe96m"><strong><u>Setting the Default Backup Schedule</u></strong></a><strong> for instructions.&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Automatically enable change tracking per VM - this setting will automatically turn on the VMware CBT (changed block tracking) feature for each VM included in differential and thin-provisioned backups. By default, this setting is enabled (Enabled is recommended).&nbsp; If this setting is disabled, and CBT is not otherwise enabled on VMware,&nbsp; a differential backup will default back to a full backup (backup logs will indicate this change.)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Backup storage tier - the Yottabyte storage tier in which to store backup data. &nbsp; By default, this is set to tier 4.&nbsp; </strong><i><strong>Note: Changing this setting affects new Full Backups only.&nbsp; (In other words: if a backup has already taken place to a different tier, differential backups will continue to store to that tier; the new setting will take effect as soon as another Full backup is performed.&nbsp;</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<p>When vSphere settings have been changed as needed, click<strong> Submit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Advanced VSphere Settings:</strong></i></p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;Click <strong>Refresh VMs</strong> on the left menu to discover VMware Virtual Machines. This will initiate a connection to the vSphere system and detected VMs will appear in the VMware Virtual Machines section of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>On the Dashboard, check&nbsp; the Status (top left).&nbsp; If the service successfully connected to the vSphere system:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Status will show as&nbsp; <strong>Online </strong>and <strong>Running</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Error Status indicates the connection was not made due to: incorrect login credentials, insecure SSL (without enabling the option for insecure SSL), invalid address, or a network issue reaching the VSphere system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxTQWFym6l3eaiuxFHST4mriX52zEXCmRBD7kRfoB7I/edit#heading=h.qffg3xf9acd0"><u>Appendix A: Troubleshooting Connection Errors</u></a> for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Creating a VMware Backup Schedule</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>What is a Schedule?</strong></h2>
<p>A schedule is a grouping of backup Tasks.&nbsp; A single schedule might include various backups, such as hourly, daily, weekly and monthly backups, and allow for taking backups at different intervals, each with different retention rules.&nbsp; Additionally, different types of backups can be included within the same schedule: Full (thick provisioned), Full (thin provisioned), and Differential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different schedules can be created to be applied to different VMs, for example: a general schedule could be used for production VMs, while a less rigorous schedule is applied to development and testing VMs; yet another schedule that includes frequent backups with shorter retention might be applied to SQL VMs, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Default Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>When a new VMWare Service is created, a Schedule named “Default” is created automatically.&nbsp; This Schedule can be modified to fit your organization’s needs.&nbsp; You can also create any number of new Schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>To Create a New Schedule:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>VMware Service Dashboard</strong> (Main Dashboard -&gt; Backup/DR → VMware -&gt; double click VMware service in the list.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Schedules</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>New</strong> on the left menu.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:486px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sQ7KHza_xKWKbKobWqNM_2wYmz4V6LZn0wBwjX6FGjbWRlIqnD19_w-NNIMQ2F3hUPLzx6a6BSfmOgEE1meRPHwMTlqsy1DsrpD1bRmhisj7Koiv8p6P89tpOmIu-7KB2dKsk6AmsSw-pFGz9rNnnQ"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> for the new Schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>Optionally, a Description</strong> can be entered to record more information.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Schedules list will appear.&nbsp; <strong>Double click the new Schedule.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point the Schedule is just an empty container; one or more tasks need to be added to the Schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>New Task </strong>on the left menu or click the <strong>+ Add Task</strong> option on the Schedule Dashboard.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter a descriptive <strong>Name</strong> for the Task (for ex: Midnight_7days; weekly_1monthretention; yearly_perpetual, etc.)</li>
  <li>Select the desired Scheduling for the backup Task.&nbsp; (Granular options allow for great flexibility in task scheduling)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Task Scheduling:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Ex: Every weekday&nbsp; at 5:15PM</strong></i></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:300px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hui3S7m6prcw5kaGJDrtDH62GwVQKkjMRgfGXzTAEiJdzqC2pOH10y2YgStw6PsazD24_e4cmpRVYdzRMsHaEJrywHdGmZYySyS5hXneidZJeU4xTUGtEDQ2n3U4-GI78p_QWegmx4Zdd5lj62LTHg"></figure>
<p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>Ex: Every 2 hours, from 7am-5pm, except for Sunday:</strong></i></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:287px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/55EU2rcVe8IVT534laJLCIQTyIGUViCYGWyxOTC8LTDkz21MyWCSatxI9agsvAnwleB-BFFAwwPlw8xEdRzaKd0aOK_jWvw3IAwFPmStAjCuxfoVNk0dqEYRjJ_sKD5DU-2UCGYyNxz6uSIvMZdiug"></figure>
<p><i><strong>Ex: Monthly, on the last day of the month:&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:309px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3fEv6RN3lxHNcnhxXNptmFcXGPN5QUBPlhfVB0cWhAja2bKUi7fXGeYnJPKcJ0Tj9ZJFAJqOcG_QEUo0rezj0lVtoC_Y_ukg4YcRIFfn7L36XcqD-fJUukkgZkoyd1UyBfJFELFErQOerF6U2wHMQg"></figure>
<p><i><strong>Ex: One time only, on 2019-04-01 at noon:</strong></i></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:331px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0Cug0k6WRpbvdEbqx7tXZASU1Qlv6mCyiKRhHDz8R7GcNGwS8nhNvjadRCArrBgU_MWUU0nu0HXdgILgKid-2rxfCW01_wjn1iPlrxDJUCvGnSGJo_QyWyAPPQantiTGb40-nniBeC1sjy6ogdPG_g"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>By default a recurring Task is set to run perpetually.&nbsp;<strong> Optionally,&nbsp; a Task Expiration </strong>can be defined which will cause the Task to cease on the selected date and time.&nbsp; To set an expiration for the Task: de-select the Never checkbox and enter desired expiration date and time.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Ex: Only run this Task until June 17, 2019 4:00AM</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>By default, Backup Job Name </strong>will default to:</li>
</ol>
<p><i>ScheduleName - TaskName-YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM</i> (ex: prodschedule -&nbsp; hourly - 2019-01-29 11:00<i> </i>for a backup created from the “prodschedule” schedule, “hourly” task, at 11AM)<strong>.</strong><i><strong>&nbsp; </strong></i><strong>Optionally, a Backup Job Name</strong> can be defined and can include any combination of these formatted date variables:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><i><strong>%Y</strong></i> 4-digit year</li>
  <li><i><strong>%m</strong></i> 2-digit month (01 to 12)</li>
  <li><i><strong>%d</strong></i> 2-digit day of the month (01 to 31)</li>
  <li><i><strong>%H </strong></i>2-digit hour (24 hour clock)</li>
  <li><i><strong>%M</strong></i> 2-digit minute (00 to 59)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>The entry: “<i>%m-%d-%Y:%H%M-sqlbackup</i>”, run on Jan 26, 2019 at 11AM produces a backup named “<i>01-26-2019:11:00-sqlbackup</i>”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the desired <strong>Backup Job Retention</strong>; this is the amount of time to keep the backup.&nbsp; (Units that can be selected: Minutes,&nbsp; Days (default), Hours, Years, Forever).&nbsp; Note: After a backup is run, expiration of individual Backup Job instances can be modified manually; backup job instances can also be manually deleted before expiration date/time.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Quiesce Snapshots</strong> option can be selected to invoke the VMWare quiesce feature (note: VMware Guest Tools required.)&nbsp; When this option is enabled, VMWare pauses running processes on the guest operating system so that the file system contents are in a known consistent state when the snapshot is taken; this process might include such operations as flushing dirty buffers from the Operating System’s in-memory cache to disk, or other application-specific tasks. &nbsp; Consult VMware documentation for more information about the quiesce feature.&nbsp; The following link provides some information: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc%2FGUID-878C36BA-6922-4269-8803-7FC419B947B7.html"><u>https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc%2FGUID-878C36BA-6922-4269-8803-7FC419B947B7.html</u></a></li>
  <li>Optionally,&nbsp; <strong>Minimum Backup Jobs to Keep</strong> can be selected. &nbsp; This setting overrides Individual backup expirations in order to keep the specified minimum number of backups (most recent) in place.&nbsp; This can provide a safety-net, intended to prevent all backups from expiring before new backups are created: for situations such as a system being powered off for a period of time or an interval of backup errors.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Select a <strong>Backup Mode</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Differential</strong> - only transfers changes since last Full VMware&nbsp; backup.&nbsp; Because of the&nbsp; way that differential backups are stored in the YB vSAN, a differential backup can be used directly and does not rely on a full backup or other differentials for a restore operation.&nbsp; <strong>*</strong>Requires Changed Block Tracking (CBT) enabled on vSphere VMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Full Backup (Thick provisioned) </strong>- Full Backup, requesting all blocks from VMware.</li>
  <li><strong>Full Backup (Thin provisioned)</strong> - Full Backup, requesting only allocated blocks from VMware. &nbsp;*Requires Changed Block Tracking (CBT) enabled on vSphere VMs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*</strong> Differential and Thin Provisioned Full backups&nbsp; utilize the CBT vSphere feature.&nbsp; Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxTQWFym6l3eaiuxFHST4mriX52zEXCmRBD7kRfoB7I/edit#bookmark=id.3izrisqrvt98"><u>Appendix B</u></a> for information and considerations regarding this feature.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Using Differential and Full Backups&nbsp;</u></strong></h3>
<p>A Full backup is needed initially and should also be done on a regular basis.&nbsp; Differential backups are quicker and use less resources/bandwidth as only changes since the last full backup are requested. &nbsp; A prudent strategy will include performing full backups on a regular basis (ex: daily, weekly, bi-weekly), with differential backups at intervals in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>When the Task is configured as desired, click <strong>Submit.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You are returned to the Schedule page and the new task will appear in the Tasks section.&nbsp; Click the <strong>+ Add Task </strong>button and repeat the above steps to append additional tasks to the schedule.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Assigning Schedules</strong></h1>
<p>Once the VMware service is created and successfully connects to the VSphere system, the list of discovered VMware Virtual Machines will appear on the VMware Service Dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Default, all VMs have schedule set to --None--.</p>
<h3><strong>To apply a Schedule to VM(s):</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>VMware Service Dashboard</strong>, click <strong>Virtual Machines</strong> on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Select the desired VM(s)</strong> from the list.&nbsp; (Selected VMs show a checked box on the left.) Hint: If you’d like to select all VMs in the list, click the checkbox in the upper left corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Edit Backup Schedules</strong> on the left menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Select</strong> the <strong>Schedule</strong> from dropdown list and click <strong>Submit.</strong></li>
  <li>The Backup Schedule assigned to each VM is displayed in the VMware VMs listing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Setting the Default Backup Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>The default VM Backup Schedule can be defined in order to automatically assign a backup schedule to all new VMware VMs discovered by the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the VMware Service Dashboard, click <strong>Edit</strong> on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In <strong>Default VM Backup Schedule,</strong> select the desired Schedule from the dropdown list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the change.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The Default Backup Schedule is displayed on the VMware Service Dashboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1><strong>Manual Backups</strong></h1>
<p>Manual backups can also be performed on VMs using the VMware service; this can be helpful in getting a backup immediately before maintenance work,&nbsp; such as: a guest OS upgrade, application update, or other configuration changes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>To Perform a Manual VM Backup:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the VMware Service Dashboard, click <strong>Virtual Machines </strong>on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Select one or more VM(s)</strong> in the list.&nbsp; (Hint: to select all VMs click the checkbox in the upper left corner.)</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Backup</strong> on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A Confirmation dialog will appear; click <strong>Yes</strong> to proceed<strong> </strong>with the backup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Return to the VMware Service Dashboard</strong> (Hint: you can use the breadcrumb at the top or the browser back button to return to the Service Dashboard.)</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Backup Jobs</strong> on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The Manual Backup should appear at the top of the listing and will display a status of “Running” until it is finished, at which point the status will show as “Complete”.</p>
<p>For manual backups, the<i> Name</i> displayed will be the name of the first VM selected for backup and the <i>Schedule Tas</i>k column will indicate&nbsp; a Manual backup.&nbsp; Additional columns display the Number of VMs backed up<i> </i>(<i>VM Count</i>),&nbsp; <i>Started</i> and <i>Finished</i> time and the <i>Expires </i>setting for the backup.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h3><strong>To Change the Name and/or Expiration of a Backup Job:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Double click the Backup Job </strong>in the listing.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Backup Job Dashboard displays.&nbsp; Click<strong> Edit</strong> on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Make <strong>changes to Name/Expires fields</strong> as desired.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>To Delete a Backup Job:</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Double click the Backup Job</strong> in the listing.</li>
  <li>The Backup Job Dashboard displays.&nbsp; Click<strong> Delete </strong>on the left menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the delete operation.</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>Restores:&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>File-level&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The VM is imported to the Yottabyte environment (From the <i>Backup Job Dashboard, double click the individual VM -&gt; click Import VM</i>.)</p>
<p>VM is powered on in the YB environment where files can be extracted to the Yottabyte NAS and accessed via CIFS or NFS.</p>
<h2><strong>Restore systems to VMware environment</strong></h2>
<p>Individual VMs or entire VMware system backup can be pushed back to the VMware environment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>DR/Business Continuity</strong></h2>
<p>VMware VMS are powered up in Yottabyte from the backup. &nbsp; Built-in, YB Site-Sync provides the mechanism to synchronize VMware backups offsite in order to be prepared for quick recovery in the event of a disaster or primary facility outage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Appendix A</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Troubleshooting VMware Connection Errors</strong></h2>
<p>Note: Check Logs (at the bottom of the Dashboard page) for possible additional information.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SSL Certificate</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If using a self-signed certificate, the option to allow insecure certificates must be enabled.&nbsp; To modify an existing VMware service: From the <i>VMware Service Dashboard -&gt; Edit -&gt; check the box for Disable SSL host certificate verification</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Appendix B</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>VMware’s Changed Block Tracking (CBT)</strong></h2>
<p>Differential and Full(Thin Provisioned) backups utilize VMware’s CBT feature, to request only blocks that have changed since the last full backup, or blocks in use.&nbsp; This can provide for quicker operations that utilize less bandwidth.&nbsp; (There is a Yottabyte option to automatically turn on CBT for all VMs.)&nbsp; The following VMware KB article provides more information,&nbsp; including VMware requirements for using CBT: <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128"><u>https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128</u></a></p>
<p><strong>CBT Considerations/Cautions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Utilizing CBT to provide faster and more efficient backups is generally fine.&nbsp; However, it is important to consider that defects in CBT can compromise backups that have utilized the feature. This is a source issue that is not controlled by any third party agent accessing VMware for backup.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The following strategies are recommended to mitigate potential risks posed by using the CBT feature:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a VMware customer/user, stay abreast of known issues and apply available updates and patches as they become available.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the past there have been bugs involving the CBT feature, for which VMware has provided patches to fix known CBT defects.</li>
  <li>Although Yottabyte stores all backups in the YB vSAN such that they are stand-alone (any backup, including differential can be used directly and does not rely on another backup for restore operations), a prudent backup strategy will include a schedule of both Full backups and Differential backups in between.&nbsp; For example, a common schedule used by many organizations is to run a Full backup weekly or twice weekly and differentials on days in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When possible, use Full-Thick Provisioned backup for those that are intended for long-term retention.</li>
</ol>
