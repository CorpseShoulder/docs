<p>The <a href="http://verge.io/">Verge.io</a> platform records user activity and displays it in the System Log.&nbsp; All logs in the system can be reviewed from the Main Dashboard and then click the <strong>Logs</strong> button in the left navigation menu.&nbsp; From this view, all logs in the system can be reviewed.<br><br>As the <a href="http://verge.io/">Verge.io</a> platform will only keep logged activity for a maximum of 45 days, logs can be exported out of the system by configuring a 3rd party log collection, for long-term record keeping.&nbsp; Setting up a 3rd party system logger can be configured from the Main Dashboard and then click on <strong>System</strong> in the left navigation menu.&nbsp; Inside the System menu, click on <strong>Settings</strong> in the left navigation menu.&nbsp; Once inside the Settings options, find the setting labeled 'Remote syslog server (tcp: @@name/ip:port, udp: @name/ip:port)'.&nbsp; Configure that setting following the implied syntax in the setting name.<br><br>Additionally, in many areas of the platform, such as a specific VM dashboard, there is a <strong>Logs</strong> button to view only logs specific to that context.&nbsp; This is often helpful in filtering out many logged events that aren't relevant to a specific area of the platform.<br><br>In the below screenshot, the log shows several specific events as examples of logged activity.<br>&nbsp;</p>
