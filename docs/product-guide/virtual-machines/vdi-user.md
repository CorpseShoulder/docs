## Using the Console
The console gives you keyboard and mouse access to the virtual machine. To access the console, simply click the desired Virtual Machine on your VDI Dashboard. Note: VM must be running; if it is not, a message will appear for you to confirm powering on the VM (permission required); click Yes to confirm. Once the VM shows running, click again to access the Remote Console. See [**Using the Console**](/product-guide/virtual-machines/vm-remote-console)  for help with working within the remote console.

## Changing Password or User Settings

<br>

### To Change your Password

1.  **Click your Username** in the top right corner.
2.  Click **Edit User** in the drop-down menu.
3.  Enter the new ***Password***
4.  Enter the new password again into the Confirm Password field.
> Password will only be accepted if it meets the requirements for your organization; requirements will appear in the tip under the confirm password entry field. (Requirements may include: a minimum length, one special character; one number; one capital letter, etc.){.is-info}
5.  Click **Submit** to save the change.
<br>

#### Two Factor Authentication
Two Factor Authentication establishes additional security for logins by requiring authorization through your associated email address, in addition to proper username and password.  **If your system administrator has required Two Factor Authentication, it is automatically enabled for all users and the option does not appear in your settings.**

If the Two Factor Authentication option is disabled (unchecked), you will simply need to enter the appropriate username and password to log in to the user interface. If the option is enabled (checked), login will also require a code that is sent to your associated email address (with an option to store the code locally for subsequent logins from the same device.) 
> When Two-Factor Authentication is enabled, it is very important that the email address configured on your account is an email to which you have access, in order to retrieve the code for successful login.{.is-warning}
