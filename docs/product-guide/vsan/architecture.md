# VergeOS vSAN Block-Level Architecture and Data Distribution

## Overview

VergeOS vSAN employs a sophisticated block-level architecture that forms the foundation of its distributed storage system. This architecture enables efficient data distribution, high availability, and optimal performance across the entire storage infrastructure.

## Block-Level Operations

### Data Block Management

- **Block Creation**:
    - VM disks are divided into multiple blocks
    - Each block is assigned a unique cryptographic hash
    - Block size is optimized for performance and efficiency
    - Metadata tracks block relationships and locations

### Hash-Based Distribution

- **Block Identification**:
    - Each data block receives a cryptographic hash value
    - Hash serves as a unique identifier for the block
    - Used for both location mapping and deduplication

- **Distribution Algorithm**:
    - Blocks are distributed based on hash values
    - Ensures even distribution across available nodes
    - Prevents hot spots in the storage system
    - Facilitates efficient data retrieval

## Data Distribution Architecture

### Primary Storage

- **Block Placement**:
    - Primary copy of each block stored on optimal node
    - Placement determined by hash-based algorithm
    - Considers storage tier requirements
    - Optimizes for performance and capacity

- **Access Patterns**:
    - Primary blocks handle regular read/write operations
    - Direct access path for optimal performance
    - Load balancing across available nodes
    - Automatic redistribution as needed

### Redundant Storage
