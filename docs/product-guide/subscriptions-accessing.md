### Viewing/Accessing All Usersâ€™ Subscriptions

From the Main Dashboard, click **System on the left menu**.
Click **Subscriptions** on the left menu.
A listing of **All Subscriptions owned by All Users displays**.
From this page, **Subscriptions can be selected for edit/delete** (with proper permissions), and new **Subscriptions can be added.**

!!! note "By default, all users can **view all** Subscriptions  but **cannot modify Subscriptions other than their own**. **Administrators can adjust User permissions** to suit their organization."

!!! tip "Throughout the VergeOS UI, the Sort and Filter Options at the top of columns can be helpful for working with longer lists."
