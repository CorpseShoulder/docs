# SR-IOV NICs

VergeOS provides support for SR-IOV-capable network cards to allow multiple instances to be shared to tenants and VMs from a single PCIe device.


!!! note "VergeOS provides full network virtualization, including emulated (virtio) NICs. SR-IOV NICs are supported (VergeOS version 4.13 and greater) for scenarios where hardware-assisted virtualization is desirable.
