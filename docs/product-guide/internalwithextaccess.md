## Creating an Internal Network with External Access

Giving an internal network external access requires having the proper default gateway rule in place to route through an external network.



<br> 

### To Automatically Create the Default Gateway Rule (during network creation)

Select an appropriate external network in the *Default Gateway* field, when creating a new internal network. The gateway will automatically create the appropriate routing rules to route to the specified network and provide LAN and/or WAN access to the internal network (depending on the physical connection/settings of the external network selected).
