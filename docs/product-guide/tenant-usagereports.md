# Running Tenant Usage Reports


VergeOS stores usage statistics per Tenant to accommodate 95th percentile billing. Additionally, max and average information are recorded.



## To Run a History Report for a Tenant:

1. Navigate to the **individual Tenant Dashboard**. 
2. Click **History** on the left menu.
3. Select **Filter Period**. (Also enter from/to dates if the custom option is selected.)
4. Click **Apply** to run the reports for the selected period.
5. Graphs will show usage for the specified period. Scroll down the page to see the statistics listing of Average, Maximum, and 95th percentile.
6. Statistics can be exported to a comma delimited text file using the **Export CSV** menu option.  

<!-- is this the easiest way to do it?  is there a more streamlined way to 
get usage reports for all tenants? -->
<!-- how about running usage reports from the API?  -->


!!! tip "The [VergeOS API](/knowledge-base/verge-api-guide) can also be utilized to send Tenant usage reports to external systems for processing."
