## Subscriptions

Subscriptions in the VergeIO platform are where administrators configure alert notifications to monitor the overall health of the system.  There are two types of alert subscriptions: On demand or scheduled.

- Subscriptions can be configured to send to an individual user or a group.
- Once an error is being tracked, a subscription alert can be temporarily halted by using the Suspend option until the issue has been resolved.

## On demand

On demand alerts are primarily used to assist in monitoring changes in the system. Some examples are:
- Site Sync transfers completing
- Hardware warnings or errors
- vSAN storage exceeding a certain used percentage

## Scheduled

Scheduled subscriptions are typically used to monitor changes over a period of time.  Tracking a particular vSAN tier's growth history, weekly, is a good example of a scheduled subscription.

## Custom Subscriptions

In addition to a number of built-in subscriptions to the VergeIO platform, administrators can build custom subscriptions to monitor particular changes.  Custom subscriptions can be created with a working knowledge of the API.
