<h1>Retrieving a Snapshot back (Sync Back)</h1>
<p>This page provides instructions for retrieving a copy of a snapshot from the sync destination back to the source system. Before a remote snapshot can be retrieved back to the source system, the sync-back must be configured; once sync-back is configured it is then available for all subsequent sync back requests.</p>
<h3>Configuring the Sync-back</h3>
<ol>
  <li>On the sending system, navigate to the <strong>Outgoing Sync Dashboard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Under the <strong>Remote</strong> section, click <strong>- Click here to Setup -</strong> link next to the <strong>Sync-back</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm setup of the sync-back.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Initiate a Sync Back</h3>
<ol>
  <li>On the sending system, navigate to the Outgoing Sync dashboard</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Remote Snaps</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li>Click to <strong>select desired snapshot(s)</strong> to sync back (selected snapshots have check mark on the left).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Request</strong> on the left menu.<ul>
      <li><i><strong>Retention</strong></i> for the retrieved snapshot will default to 3 Days; can be changed as desired. (Changing retention setting here does not affect the retention in place for the snapshot on the remote system.)</li>
      <li><i><strong>Priority</strong></i> (0-9) can be specified, with lower number to sync before higher number; only relevant when multiple sync backs will be initiated.</li>
      <li>Optionally, a <i><strong>Prefix</strong></i> can be added to the snapshot name in order to clearly distinguish it from other snapshots; text entered in this field is appended to the beginning of the existing snapshot name for the retrieved copy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After options are configured as desired, click <strong>Submit</strong> to initiate the sync-back</li>
</ol>
