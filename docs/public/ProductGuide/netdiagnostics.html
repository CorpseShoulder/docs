<h1>The Network Diagnostics Tool</h1>
<p>The built-in Diagnostics query engine allows quick and easy access to extended network information, such as DNS queries, traceroute, ping, arp, TPC Dump, BGP Quagga. The Diagnostics Tool is available for each network.</p>
<h3>To Access Diagnostics:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the desired <strong>Network Dashboard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Diagnostics</strong> on the left menu.</li>
  <li>The Query list dropdown provides a comprehensive set of available diagnostic queries.</li>

<h4>ARP Table</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Standard ARP cache</li>
</ul>
<h4>ARP Scan</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Standard ARP scan tool used to discover all active devices in an IPV4 range. Caution should be used as an ARP scan has the potential to be disruptive to a network.</li>
</ul>
<h4>DNS Lookup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Test DNS functionality from your network, searching specific host names/query types.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Show Firewall Rules</h4>
<ul>
  <li>NFT format (low-level) translation of network firewall rules. Typically, viewing firewall configuration through the Verge.io UI (Rules) will be adequate. This query is made available for advanced firewall troubleshooting.</li>

This can be helpful to track a network that might be flooded from an external source.</li>
</ul>
