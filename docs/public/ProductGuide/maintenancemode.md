# Maintenance Mode

Maintenance Mode prepares a node to be taken offline.Â **Maintenance Mode should be used prior to any operation that will include a reboot / powercycle or will otherwise render the node unavailable.**


<br>

## Putting a Node into Maintenance Mode
When a node is put into Maintenance Mode the system attempts to gracefully migrate all workloads (including virtual machines, tenant nodes, vNet containers) to different nodes within the cluster.

> **Non-Migratable Workloads:** VMs that cannot be migrated, e.g. those containing GPU devices or employing virtualization passthrough (CPU type = host processor), need to be powered down and restarted on another suitable node or powered on again when the node maintenance is completed. Setting a VM's Migration Method = Automatic allows the system to automatically power down a non-migratable VM when a node is put into maintenance; otherwise, the VM will need to be powered down manually.{.is-info}


1. **IMPORTANT: Before starting any maintenance, verify node servers can be reached via a backup method, i.e. physical console or ipmi access.** {.is-warning}

2.  From the main dashboard, click **Nodes**.
3.  **Double-click the desired node** in the list.
4.  Click **Enable Maintenance** on the left menu.
The system will only allow putting a node into Maintenance Mode when proper conditions are detected, such as: all other nodes are running, no nodes currently in maintenance mode, no drive repairs in progress, sufficient memory in place for redundancy, etc.
5.  A Confirmation message will appear. Click **Yes** to continue with placing the node into Maintenance Mode.
6.  **Monitor Progress.** The node dashboard will provide information about the Maintenance Mode progress:

- **Node Logs**
	Scroll to the bottom of the node dashboard to view node logs.  A log entry will appear for each machine the system attempts to migrate. A log entry indicating the status is now *'Maintenance Mode'* indicates when the maintenance process completes successfully.

  <br>
  If any machines could not be migrated, an error entry will appear in the node logs; those machines will need to be powered off manually; see note above regarding Non-Migratable workloads.

 <br>
  
- **Running Machines**
The *Running Machines* section indicates workloads currently on the node, both running and migrating. To successfully move into maintenance mode, all running machines need to be migrated or powered off; the Running Machines section willl be empty when this has occurred.

<br>

- **Node Status**
Node Status is displayed at the top of the node dashboard. While a node is in the process of migrating workloads, a status of ***"Migrating"*** is displayed.

<br>
 A status of ***"Maintenance Mode"*** indicates that all workloads have been successfully migrated/powered off.

 <br>
 <br>

7.  After verifying the ***Node Status*** displays **Maintenance Mode**, perform maintenance operations,  
    using the **Reboot** **\-And/Or-** **Power Off** options (on the left menu of the node dashboard) as needed.
    
8. **After all service is completed** and the node is ready to be utilized again, **take the node out of Maintenance Mode** so it can service workloads again.

## Taking a Node out of Maintenance Mode

> Take a node out of maintenance **when all powercycle/reboot operations are complete** and it is ready to come back into service. {.is-info}

1.  From the **node dashboard**, click **Disable Maintenance** on the left menu.
2.  A Confirmation message will appear. Click **Yes** to continue taking the node out of Maintenance Mode.
3.  The ***Node Status*** displays "Leaving Maintenance" while in the process of coming out of Maintenance Mode.

<br>

4.  The ***Node Status*** field will display "Running" when it has fully come out of Maintenance Mode and workloads have been migrated back to the node.

<br>

5.  If necessary,  **power on any non-migratable VMs or tenant nodes that were shutdown for maintenance**.
