<h2>Console Toolbar</h2>
<p>All toolbar options (except the Exit button) work as a toggle, switching between on/open or off/closed. For example: clicking the chat button opens the chat window, and clicking the button again closes the chat window. A button is orange when on/open; and is white when off/closed.</p>
