# Importing VMs from Uploaded Media Images

Importing via Media Images is a convenient way to import a single VM at a time. VM Data files, such as VMX, VMDK, OVF, VHD(X) are uploaded to the vSAN and then selected for import.

## Import VM (config and disks) from Media Images

> Hyper-V VMs should be exported to \*.ova/ovf or VMware format before upload, **-OR-** use the ***Create VM Shell, Import VM Disks*** method below to create the VM first and then import disks{.is-info}

1.  Upload configuration and disk image files to the vSAN. For instructions on uploading files to the vSAN, see [**Media Images**](/public/ProductGuide/uploadingtovSAN).
2.  From the Main Dashboard, Click **Machines** from the left menu.
3.  Click **New VM** from the left menu.
4.  From the options list, select **\--Import from Media Images--**. Available files (that have been uploaded to the vSAN via **Media Images**) will appear in the Selections Available list on the right side. Click to **select the VM configuration file** (e.g. \*.vmx, \*.ovf)
5.  Click **Next** (bottom of the screen).
6.  The ***VM Name*** will default to the name of the selected configuration file if left blank; otherwise a name can be specified.
7.  By default ***MAC Address(es)*** of VM NICs will stay the same as the source VM. If this option is unselected, the system will generate new, unique MAC address(es).
8.  Select ***Preferred Tier***, or leave at --default--. This determines the tier first attempted for VM storage. See the [**Preferred Tier**](/public/ProductGuide/preferredtiers) page for more information.
9.  When fields are entered as desired, click **Submit**.
10.  The VM instance is created and the dashboard for the new VM is presented.
