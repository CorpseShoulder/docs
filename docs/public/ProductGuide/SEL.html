<h2>The System Event Log (SEL)</h2>
<p>The System Event Log (SEL) contains events from the hardware IPMI interface. Since this log is stored on hardware there is a limited capacity; after the SEL is full, new events cannot be recorded until it is cleared. The Node dashboard displays a percentage bar to indicate the amount of SEL capacity currently used.</p>
