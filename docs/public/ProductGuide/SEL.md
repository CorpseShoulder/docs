# The System Event Log (SEL)

The System Event Log (SEL) contains events from the hardware IPMI interface. Since this log is stored on hardware there is a limited capacity; after the SEL is full, new events cannot be recorded until it is cleared. The node dashboard displays a percentage bar to indicate the amount of SEL capacity currently used.

2.  **Double-click the desired Node** to access the **Node dashboard**.
3.  Click **Clear SEL** on the left menu.
4.  Click **Yes** to confirm.
