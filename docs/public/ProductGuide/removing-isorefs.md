# Removing ISO Files with References

ISO files that are currently referenced (loaded on a CD-ROM drive) cannot be deleted until those references are removed.

## To View Existing References of an ISO File

1.  From the Main Dashboard, click **Media Images** on the left menu.
2.  Click to **select the desired ISO file.**
3.  Click **View References** on the left menu.
A listing page will appear to display CD-ROM drives referencing this ISO. Individual entries can be clicked to access the Edit form, from which the Media File can be modified to select a different ISO if desired. The directions below provide steps to delete all ISO references at once.
