# Subscription Profiles
Subscription profiles define the information to send in a subscription notification.
A comprehensive array of subscription profiles is included, by default, with installation. Additional Profiles may be added with some VergeIO software updates. The standard set of subscription profiles provides all the needed alerts/reports for most cases. However, further subscription profiles can be added via the user interface; contact support for assistance.

Available Subscription Profiles appear for selection in the dropdown fields when creating a new Subscription.
