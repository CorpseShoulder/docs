<h1>Virtual Machine Drives</h1>
<h2>How To Quick Reference</h2>
<h3>Add a New Drive to a VM</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the VM Dashboard, click <strong>New Drive</strong> on the left menu (near the bottom).</li>
  <li>Enter a <i><strong>Name</strong></i> for the drive (optional).</li>
</ol>
<p><i>When the Name is not specified, the system automatically names drives in order as created, "drive_x" where x is an integer starting with 0. For drives that will be used as a "Golden Image", it is recommended to give a Name to the drive for easy selection when creating non-persistent drives that will reference the drive.</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>The <i><strong>Read Only</strong></i> option can be useful for a drive that should not be modified, such as on a VM restore that is used to recover data.</li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Media</strong></i> (type) for the drive:<ul>
      <li><strong>Disk (default option)</strong> - empty disk; emulates typical SSD/HDD device</li>
      <li><strong>CD-ROM</strong> - emulates CD-ROM device; read-only; associated *.iso file simulates inserted CD media; typically used for installing OS or other software.</li>
      <li><strong>Clone Disk</strong> - create a duplicate of an existing disk from the same Verge.io Cloud.</li>
      <li><strong>EFI Disk</strong> - this drive type is auto-generated and handled by the system; there should never be a need to manually create a drive of this type.</li>
      <li><strong>Import Disk</strong> - allows selection of a standard format disk file (*.raw,*.vmdk,*.qcow, *.vhd(x), etc).</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Persistent</strong> - allows for a drive that does not maintain changes between boots; each time the VM is started, the non-persistent drive reverts back to the *.raw file image (an existing Disk Drive in the Verge.io Cloud) to which it is referenced. A typical use for the Non-Persistent drive would be maintaining a “golden image” OS install where all updates and modifications can be made centrally; this is particularly useful for solutions, such as VDI, where a consistent installation needs to be maintained for many virtual machines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Interface</strong></i>:<ul>
      <li><strong>Virtio-SCSI</strong> - (typically recommended option). provides para-virtualized SCSI device; with high performance, while still maintaining standard command set, device passthrough, and device naming within guest OS. There is built-in support in most Linux distros, but not standard in default Windows installations, however, Virtio Drivers are available at: <a href="https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso">https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso</a> ; virtio drivers are also included within Verge.io custom Windows *.iso files.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtio(Legacy)</strong> - this driver was previously scheduled to be phased out; however, development has commenced again. It can be used for utmost I/O performance with the tradeoff being that some native SCSI features, such as TRIM are not supported.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtio-SCSI (Dedicated Controller)</strong> - provides a para-virtualized SCSI device with its own controller. Use this option if adding a virtio-SCSI drive to reside on a different storage tier than existing virtio-SCSI drives within the same VM. For example, if tier 3 virtio-SCSI drive(s) have already been created for the VM, create a tier 2 Virtio-SCSI drive as Dedicated Controller to keep the different tiered drives on separate virtual controllers.</li>
      <li><strong>LSI***</strong> - LSI, native VMware options provided for compatibility, where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>SATA(AHCI)</strong> - option only applies to VMs with a Q35 Machine Type.</li>
      <li><strong>IDE</strong> - option only applies to VMs with a PC (i440FX) Machine Type.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Disk Size</strong></i>. This option only applies to Media type: <strong>Disk</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Media File</strong></i>. This option only applies to Media Type: <strong>CD-ROM/Clone Disk/Import Disk/ Non-Persistent</strong>.<ul>
      <li>*For CD-ROM: Select *.iso file from the dropdown list. Note: *.iso file can also be selected after VM creation.</li>
      <li>For Clone Disk: Select *.raw file from the dropdown list</li>
      <li>For Import Disk: Select disk image file* from the dropdown list. Supported file types: (*.raw, *.qcow, *.qcow2, *.vhd, *.vhdx, *.vmdk)</li>
      <li>For Non-Persistent Disk: Select *.raw file from the dropdown list displaying all existing Verge.io drives in this Verge.io Cloud.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select <i><strong>Preferred Tier</strong></i>. This option only applies to Media types: <strong>Disk/EFI Disk</strong>.<ul>
      <li>Options include all storage tiers to which you have access.</li>
      <li><strong>--Default--</strong> can also be selected to use the default storage tier defined for this cloud in System Settings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select the <i><strong>Override Preferred Tier</strong></i> checkbox: (only applies to Media type: <strong>Clone Disk/Import Disk /Non-Persistent</strong>), if a different Tier is desired (different from the current tier of the selected Media File.) This option only applies to Media Type: <strong>CD-ROM/Clone Disk/Import Disk/ Non-Persistent</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter a <i><strong>Description </strong></i>for the drive (optional, but recommended when there will be more than one drive)</li>
  <li>The <i><strong>Asset</strong></i> field can be used to define a unique identifier for this drive (e.g. OS, Data drive, etc.) for a drive that can be used within Recipes.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit.</strong></li>
  <li>Repeat the process to add more drives to the VM, as needed.</li>
</ol>
