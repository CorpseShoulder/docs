This allows a single sign-on experience for users as credentials from the defined authorization source can be appointed for users to log in to a VergeIO system.</p> <p></p> <p>Catalog A catalog is a group of related recipes. For example, one catalog may contain many varied Windows VM recipes, while another catalog in the same repository could contain all Linux-based VM recipes. Customers can group recipes into catalogs in whatever way makes sense for their particular organization.</p> <p></p> <p>Cloud (VergeIO Cloud) In VergeIO, \"cloud\" refers to each autonomous Virtual Data Center (VDC) created within a VergeIO system. This includes the VDC created at the base level (when VergeIO is installed on physical hardware) as well as the VDC that is created with each subsequent tenant and subtenant.</p> <p></p> <p>Cluster A cluster is a group of nodes (physical or virtual) with like hardware resources, used as a pool for storage, compute, or HCI functions. A single VergeIO system can contain a variety of different clusters to provide an array of performance/costing options. The resources of a single cluster can be divided up among multiple tenants and a single tenant can be given resources to multiple clusters within the same system.</p> <p></p> <p>Host Refers to the top-level Virtual Data Center(VDC), aka VergeIO cloud, which is created during the initial VergeIO install on the physical hardware. The Host has direct control over the hardware, whereas tenants/subtentants will have resources assigned to them, but no access to physical components.</p> <p></p> <p>Media Images Media Images are files uploaded to the VergeIO vSAN to make available inside the VergeIO environment. Common files uploaded are those used for installing new virtual machines (e.g. *.iso) or importing machines or drives from existing systems (e.g. *.ova, *.ovf, *.raw, *.qcow, *.vmdk, etc).</p> <p></p> <p>Nested Multi-Tenancy Nested Multi-Tenancy provides layers of tenancy; the host tenant can allocate any portion of its base resources to child tenants and those child tenants can then divide and apportion any of its resources down to its own child tenants, and so on.</p> <p></p> <p>Network (Core) The Core Network is a virtual network used to handle all intra-node communication. Every VergeIO cloud has 1 Core Network, which is created automatically during the VergeIO installation (on the Host) or at the point of tenant creation (for each tenant.)</p> <p></p> <p>Network (DMZ) The DMZ Network is a virtual network used to connect all other networks with the Core Network. Every VergeIO cloud has 1 DMZ Network, which is created automatically during the VergeIO installation (on the Host) or at the point of tenant creation (for each tenant.)</p> <p></p> <p>Network (External) An External Network is a network outside of the VergeIO system; any pre-existing network that will be interfaced with VergeIO (e.g. company LAN, direct WAN connections, Wi-Fi networks). In a VergeIO system, there is typically at least one External Network and there can be multiple External networks. External Networks can be defined during or after VergeIO system installation.</p> <p>Note: External does not necessarily indicate that the network is a direct Internet Connection (although it can be), but rather only External to the VergeIO system.</p> <p></p> <p>Network (Internal) An Internal Network is a virtual network originated within VergeIO. Any number of Internal Networks can be created. An Internal Network is created default-secure; with built-in VergeIO networking functionality allowing for opening up access between Internal Networks and to External Networks as needed.</p> <p></p> <p>Network (Maintenance) A Maintenance Network is an External network that can be created to handle IPMI access to Physical nodes and optional PXE boot.</p> <p></p> <p>Node (Physical) Physical nodes are actual hardware servers that host the base VergeIO cloud.</p> <p></p> <p>Node (Tenant) Tenant nodes are virtual servers that simulate physical nodes. Each tenant is assigned at least one tenant node and more tenant nodes can be added for scale and/or to accommodate clustering software such as Kubernetes, Hadoop, etc..</p> <p></p> <p>Recipe (VM) A VM recipe is a customizable template for launching new virtual machine instances. A VM recipe can include initial hardware specifications (e.g. number of cores, RAM, CPU type, drives, NICs, etc). and resource pool specification. Additionally, custom fields can be added to the recipe to gather input at the time of recipe consumption. This data, input by the recipe consumer, can then be utilized to adjust elements within the new VM guest OS; typically at first startup. For example, a recipe can be configured to prompt for a database username and password, or for disk/ram size settings to input into an application conf file. VergeIO VM recipes are compatible with Cloud-Init. See https://cloud-init.io for cloud-init documentation.</p> <p></p> <p>Recipe (Tenant) A tenant tecipe is a customizable template for creating a new tenant instance. A tenant recipe can include predefined settings for configuration/resource allocation and can include custom fields to gather input at the time of recipe consumption in order to adjust elements of the resulting tenant instance.</p> <p></p> <p>Recipe Consumer The recipe consumer is the vergeIO user creating a new tenant or VM instance using a recipe.</p> <p></p> <p>Repair Server A repair server provides a potential reconstruction mechanism for a system that experienced a problem extending beyond its redundancy tolerance (e.g. simultaneous, multiple drive failures spanning multiple nodes). Typically, a repair server is a sync destination that contains a fairly recent replication of the given system. A repair server will automatically attempt to pull back any needed blocks from the remote system, potentially avoiding the need to roll back using a snapshot. It is generally recommended to have a repair server in place whenever possible.</p> <p></p> <p>Repository A repository is a site collection of recipe catalogs. Typically, a tenant has access to a repository provided by its VergeIO service provider. Each tenant can also create a local repository to store its own recipe catalogs.</p> <p>The vergeIO Repository is also included by default on a VergeIO Installation. The VergeIO Repository includes the standard NAS Service VM.</p> <p></p> <p>Site A site is a VergeIO system with its own physical hardware. Typically VergeIO sites are separated by geographical location. Multiple sites can be synchronized to allow for robust disaster recovery/business continuity options.</p> <p></p> <p>Sites Dashboard The Sites Dashboard provides a central page for monitoring and administering multiple systems.  Top-level statistics from included locations are aggregated to a single screen, with drill-down options to access individual sites and view more detailed information.  </p> <p></p> <p>Snapshot A snapshot captures the state of an entity at a particular point in time. Snapshots can be used to create point-in-time capture of an entire VergeIO cloud, tenant, an individual virtual machine, or a NAS volume. Snapshots allow \"rolling back\" a system, which can be helpful for recovery, development, and testing purposes.</p> <p></p> <p>Snapshot Profile A snapshot profile defines a schedule for snapshot creation and cleanup.</p> <p></p> <p>Storage Tier A Storage Tier is a pool of storage with equivalent underlying physical storage devices. Storage Tiering is a feature built into the VergeIO vSAN, allowing splitting data between different types of physical media based on requirements for performance, accessibility, capacity, and cost. Storage tiering can dramatically reduce costs by taking better advantage of more expensive disks where most needed while using less expensive (e.g. spinning disk) for cold storage, like archives, etc. See vSAN Tiers for a description of standard Storage Tiers.</p> <p></p> <p>Subscriptions Subscriptions allow for monitoring a system (or components of a system) by defining system information to send to users via Email.</p> <ul> <li>Subscriptions with the On Demand type send alerts triggered by warnings, errors, or thresholds.</li> <li>Subscriptions with the Scheduled type send reporting information at regularly scheduled intervals (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly, etc).</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Subscription Profiles Subscription profiles define the aspects of a subscription (on Demand/Scheduled, trigger criteria/schedule). Many subscription profiles are pre-loaded by default with the VergeIO Install. Additional subscription profiles can also be created.</p> <p></p> <p>Tenant A tenant is a complete and separate Virtual Data Center, running its own instance of the VergeIO OS. Child tenants are apportioned from a parent VergeIO cloud. The nested, multi-tenancy infrastructure allows each VergeIO cloud to subdivide any portion of its resources to provide multiple, sub-divisions of resources. Each tenant is a complete VergeIO cloud with its own storage, networking, and security. Tenants are isolated from each other, with each autonomously managed. This provides the mechanism for service providers or IT departments to allocate and administer resources dynamically, keeping autonomous units for different customers/business groups.</p> <p></p> <p>VergeOS The VergeIO Operating System (Verge OS) is a complete operating system specifically designed for rapidly deployed, complete virtual data centers, with nested tenancy functionality. Verge OS is installed/run directly on base hardware as well as within virtual nodes (used for tenants).</p> <p></p> <p>vGPU A vGPU is a physical GPU installed on a host node that is dissected into multiple virtual GPUs. vGPU provides access to multiple VMs simultaneously from a single piece of GPU hardware.</p> <p></p> <p>Volume A Volume is a directory structure/collection of files within a VergeIO NAS. A VergeIO NAS can contain one or more Volumes, with each individual Volume allowing different settings for aspects such as security, snapshot, tiering, max size, Anti-Virus settings, shares, etc.</p> <ul> <li>Remote Volume - mounts a pre-existing (external) NFS or CIFS file system to make it accessible within a VergeIO system.</li> <li>Local Volume - stored within the VergeIO vSAN</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Need more Help?

Following this article, administrators should first determine when the unexplained growth happened (Review vSAN Tiers for growth history) and then review possible areas for unexpected growth (Possible Reasons for Storage Increase).</p> <p>Review vSAN Tiers for growth history The best way to isolate unexplained growth is to narrow down when growth increased, exponentially. Using the following steps, administrators can review storage growth. With this, they can visualize normal growth from daily operations versus spikes in growth which are typically unexpected. Navigate to the vSAN Tiers from the Main Dashboard. If vSAN Tiers is not present on the dashboard, then this environment is a tenant of a parent system.  The vSAN tier needs to be examined at the parent system. Open the vSAN Tier with unexpected growth (example, vSAN Tier 0). On the left navigation menu click on History. A new menu system will appear showing history in various graphs, modify the Filter period to isolate if any growth is noted on this tier. It's recommended to start with a custom filter of 1 day, and review the Storage Usage graph.</p> <p>Things to note: If every hour there is a dip and then a spike, or possibly once a day, then this is most likely the result of snapshots falling out of retention as normal (old ones expiring and new ones are created). If found, note if the total storage consumed at the start of the day is nearly equivalent to the end of the day. If so, expand the customer filter to a week. If observing a week, note if the total storage consumed on this tier at the start of the week, relative to the total storage consumed at the end of the week.  If for example, the growth is roughly 10%, then change the time filter to a week prior.  Does the growth percentage week after week seem to fairly consistent? If so, this represents an average of your weekly growth (change) rate. This percentage can help a system administrator plan for future hardware expansion. Lastly, filter on the current month and note if there are any sudden spikes in storage consumption on the Storage Usage Graph.  This will likely represent when unexpected storage was consumed by the system.  In the below example, between April 11th and April 13th, there was a 30GB increase in storage.  This suggests a time frame to focus on.  You can click and drag a mouse over the time in question to zoom in to a more detailed time window.  At any point you can hover the mouse cursor over the graph and specific date/time information will be displayed below the graph.</p> <p></p> <p>Possible Reasons for Storage increase There are several areas of the VergeIO platform that leverage storage; the most common areas where customers have unexpected growth are listed below. - Review Cloud Snapshots.  Navigate from the Main Dashboard to System&gt;Cloud Snapshots.     - Are any being held past the expected expiration time?    - Are there snapshots that do not have a Snapshot Profile set?  If so, these were taken manually.  Investigate when and why the snapshot was taken.   - Are there any snapshots set to Never Expire? Over time, this can end up consuming large amounts of data. - Review Virtual Machines for machine-level snapshots   - Navigate to the Machines Dashboard.  In the Count Box titled Snapshots contains a count of all the machine-level snapshots present in the system.  Clicking on this box will list each virtual machine-level snapshot and the date/time when it was created. If any are present, review if they can be removed.   - Navigate to Machines&gt;Virtual Machines.  In the virtual Machine list view, sort on the column Snapshot Profile. any VM with a value in this field is taking machine-level snapshots.  These individual machine snapshots are also contained within the overall cloud snapshots which are also taken on a recurring schedule.  If so, review if this is needed or if the individual machine snapshots can be removed. - Review VMWare Backup jobs for long retention periods   - Navigate to Backup/DR&gt;VMware Services.  Review each configured VMWare Service instance for individual Backup Job history.   - On the left navigation menu, click on Backup Jobs to review each specific instance of a backup of a remote VMWare system.  Note the expiration date under the Expires column.  Review each backup job to determine if the backup can be removed. - Review Media Images for any recently added files   - Navigate to Media Images.  Sort by Modified.  Review if the time frame of the unexplained growth matches any upload dates/times for Media Images.   - Review if any media images, especially other hypervisor image formats (for example .ova or .vhdx) can be removed from the system. - Review if there are any Incoming Site Syncs   - Navigate to Backup/DR&gt;Incoming Syncs.  If any are present, open the dashboard of each Incoming sync and review the number represented in the Received Snapshots count box.  This is the current number of remote snapshots.  In this scenario, investigate the Source (Origin) site to determine if there was an increase in storage that matches the same time frame in question. - Review each tenant for unexpected Used Storage increases   - Navigate to Tenants&gt;Tenants&gt;Each tenant dashboard   - Review the Total Storage Used at each tenant by clicking on History in the left navigation menu.  Follow the same process listed above for reviewing growth history.   - If unexplained growth is found, administrators will need to search inside the tenant for all of the same possible reasons of storage increase (listed above), and possibly inside sub-tenants, if any are present.</p> <p></p> <p>Need more Help?

At its base, a network is built off of the linux [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page) kernel module.   Can a network run as a DHCP client?  An externally facing network has the ability to become a DHCP client, an internal network does not. It can however be a router with a static IP and serve a different DHCP server address to virtual machines attached to it.     Can I use my existing storage infrastructure with a VergeIO environment?  Guest workloads can be connected to external storage, but VergeIO cannot leverage 3rd party storage architectures.   What is VergeIO based on?  VergeIO is a custom linux distro.   Can I install VergeIO myself?  Yes, follow the installation instructions [here](/public/implementation/3-2).   Can I run containers?  Containers cannot be run natively in VergeIO. However running containers can be achieved by creating a virtual machine and running your specific containerization platform inside of the vm.   Can I use my existing VXLAN(s) inside of the environment?  VXLAN capabilities within VergeIO do not extend outside of the environment. They are created specifically to control high availability of any network that exists inside of VergeIO.   What drive format do virtual disks use?  Virtual disks use the **.raw** format since it is the most universal drive format.   Can I run a single node?  A miniumum of two nodes are required to maintain high availability.   How often do you release updates?  Bug fixes, hotfixes, security updates are released on an un-fixed schedule as needed.  Platform updates with additional features are released quarterly.   How does the vSAN ensure data integrity?  The vSAN stores a SHA1 hash of every block of data that is written to it. When that data is read, it is re-hashed and validated for integrity. This technique protects against silent corruption and bit rot. In the event of finding a bad block of data, our algorithm will check for redundant copies locally within the environment. If that block of data cannot be found, DR/Backup sites will be checked in real time, and the data block will be retrieved and repaired seamlessly without user interaction with no down time.   Can I use large spinning drives in my environment?  Yes, VergeIO does not have a size limitation on drives. It is important to note that through extensive research and testing that drives larger than 8TB in size are not recommended. Typically the rebuild time in larger drives can take an extended period of time leaving the possibility for a single point of failure. Spinning disks aren't recommended for production (hot) data and are typically used for archive/backup environments or (cold) data.   How are updates performed?  Updates can be run in two forms, either a rolling update or a full environment reboot.    - #### Rolling Update     A rolling update gracefully puts each node into maintenance mode applying the update to one node at a time. During maintenance mode all guest workloads are gracefully moved to another running node within the same cluster using a stateful start/stop method providing minimal interruption. Once the physical node is rebooted it will automatically leave maintenance mode and return the workloads to their original physical node.   - #### Environment Reboot      An environment reboot requires all running workloads to be shutdown and the physical nodes to be rebooted all at once. While this method is faster it does require downtime for all running workloads.   What RAID level does the vSAN work at?  The VergeIO vSAN works as a Redundant Array of Independant Nodes (RAIN). This is accomplished by striping the data across all drives in a tier of storage while concurrently writing the data set to its mirror on another node participating in the same tier of storage thereby guaranteeing data integrity.   Can VergeIO restrict, disable, and prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions, ports, protocols, and services?  VergeIO will not control anything within the guest. Port management of traffic, protocols, and services can be managed via the VergeIO firewall.    How does VergeIO isolate service-specific traffic?  Creating different internal networks inside the VergeIO platform allows for the delivery of multiple manageable networks that are all completely isolated from one another.   Can data be taken or read from an individual drive in VergeIO?  No, all data is cryptohashed and cryptoverified on every disk VergeIO is installed on.   Does VergeIO support encryption?  Data at rest (DARE) is AES 256bit encrypted **if** encryption is turned on at the time of install.   How is data between VergeIO sites encrypted?  SSL encryption, and AES 256 for synchronization.   How does VergeIO handle network isolation?  VxLAN and containerized networks. VxLANs give you the ability to segregate networks with the same IP address scheme.   How much compute resources does a vnet container use?  The containers are designed to only have network functions running. The resources used to run them are extremely minimal.   Does a vnet have IPAM capabilities?  Only if the vnet is the router and/or dhcp server for the network.   Is Active Directory/LDAP or SAML supported?  No, to view a list of supported auth sources please see the [auth sources](/public/auth) wiki page.   \ud83d\ude97 Take a Test Drive Today!"},{"location":"public/glossary/","title":"Glossary","text":"Auth Source    An auth source defines a user management authority (GitLab, Google, OpenID) for a VergeIO environment. This allows a single sign-on experience for users as credentials from the defined auth source can be appointed for users to login to a VergeIO envrironment.     Breadcrumbs    Breadcrumbs are links at the top of the screen that reflect the recent history of selected sections; these links provide quick access back to previous screens.    Catalog    A catalog is a group of related recipes. For example one catalog may contain many varied Windows vm recipes, while another catalog in the same repository could contain all Linux based vm recipes. Administrators can group recipes into catalogs in whatever way makes sense for their particular organization.     Cluster    A cluster is a group of nodes consisting of like hardware resources, used as a pool for storage, compute or HCI functions. A single VergeIO environment can contain different types of clusters to provide an array of performance/costing options. The resources of a single cluster can be divided up among multiple tenants and a single tenant can be given resources to multiple clusters within the same environment.  Host   Refers to the top-level Virtual Data Center (VDC), aka \"root\", which is created during the initial VergeIO install on physical hardware. The host has direct control over the hardware, whereas tenants/subtentants will have resources assigned to them, but no visibility into the underlying infrastructure.     Media Images    Media images are files uploaded to the VergeIO vSAN to make available inside the VergeIO environment. Common files uploaded are those used for installing new virtual machines (e.g. \\*.iso) or importing Machines or drives from existing systems (e.g. \\*.ova, \\*.ovf, \\*.raw, \\*.qcow, \\*.vmdk, etc).     Nested Multi-Tenancy    Nested Multi-Tenancy provides individual layers of secure tenancy. The host can allocate any portion of its physical resources to child tenants and those child tenants can then divide and apportion any of its resources down to its own child tenants.     Network    - #### Core     The core network is a highly available virtual network used to handle all inter-node communication. Every VergeIO environment has 1 core network, which is created automatically during installation on the host or at the point of tenant creation (for each tenant).   - #### DMZ     The dmz network is a virtual network used to connect all networks with each other. Every VergeIO environment has 1 dmz network, which is created automatically during installation on the host or at the point of tenant creation (for each tenant).   - #### External     An external network is a network that exists outside of the VergeIO environment. Any pre-existing network that will be interfaced with VergeIO (e.g. company LAN, direct WAN connections, wi-fi networks) is considered to be an external network. In a VergeIO system there is at least one external that is used to communicate to the UI and send traffic out of the environment.   - #### Internal     An internal network is a virtual network originated within VergeIO. Any number of internal networks can be created. An internal network is created default-secure; with built-in VergeIO networking functionality allowing for opening up access between internal networks and/or external networks as needed.   - #### Maintenance     A maintenance network is an external network that can be created to handle IPMI access to physical nodes and optional PXE boot.   - #### Physical     A physical network is a representation of each isolated layer 2 network. Physical networks are typically configured during install. The system automatically appends \" Switch\" to the end of the user-supplied name during install, for ex: for name \"PXE\", the system will give the physical network the name \"PXE Switch\".     Node    - #### Physical     Physical nodes are actual hardware servers that host the base VergeIO environment   - #### Tenant     Tenant nodes are virtual servers that simulate physical nodes. Each tenant is assigned at least one tenant node with the ability to add more tenant nodes on the fly for scale and/or to accommodate clustering software.     Recipe    - #### VM      Enables the ability to create a virtual machine using a set of predefined questions to automate a number of tasks that would normally be done manually.   - #### Tenant     Enables the ability to create entire tenants with specific workloads, network settings, and/or other custom configurations already created in them using a set of predefined questions.     Repository    A repository is a site collection of recipe catalogs. Typically, a tenant has access to a repository provided by its service provider. Each tenant can also create a local repository to store its own recipe catalogs. The VergeIO repository is also included by default on a VergeIO installation. The VergeIO repository includes the standard NAS Service VM and a \"30 Day Trial POC\" tenant.     Scale Out    Scale out is the process of adding net new additional resources to an environment. I.E, adding another storage or compute node would be considered a scale out process.     Scale Up    Scale up is the process of adding hardware into already existing nodes of an environment. I.E, adding more drives to a storage node or increasing RAM in a compute node would be considered a scale up process.     Snapshot    A snapshot captures the state of an entity at a particular point in time. Snapshots can be used to create a point-in-time capture of an entire environment, tenant, individual virtual machine, or a NAS volume. Snapshots allow \"rolling back\" a system, which can be helpful for recovery, development and testing purposes.      Snapshot Profile    A snapshot profile defines a schedule for snapshot creation and cleanup.     Storage Tier    A storage tier is a pool of storage with equivalent underlying physical storage devices. Storage tiering is a feature built into the VergeIO vSAN allowing splitting data between different types of physical media based on requirements for performance, accessibility, capacity and cost. Storage tiering can dramatically reduce costs by taking better advantage of more expensive disk where it's most needed while using less expensive (e.g. spinning disk) for cold storage.     Subscriptions    Subscriptions allow for monitoring a system (or components of a system) by defining system information to send to users via email.     Subscription Profiles    Subscription profiles define the aspects of a subscription (on demand/scheduled, trigger criteria/schedule). Many subscription profiles are pre-loaded by default with the VergeIO install. Custom subscription profiles can also be created with knowledge of the API.     Sync   The process of syncronizing blocks of data between two VergeIO environments to facilitate DR capabilities or archive backups.     Tenant   A tenant is a completely separate Virtual Data Center, running its own instance of VergeIO. Child tenants are apportioned from a parent VergeIO environment. The nested, multi-tenancy infrastructure allows each VergeIO environment to divide any portion of its resources to provide multiple, sub-divisions of resources. Each tenant is allocated its own storage, networking, and compute resources. Tenants are isolated from each other, with each being individually managed by its own UI. This provides the mechanism for service providers or IT departments to allocate and administer resources dynamically.     Virtual Wire   A virtual wire is the logical process of plugging a cable into a switch. Creating a virtual wire enables the ability to pass a layer 2 network into a tenant.     \ud83d\ude97 Take a Test Drive Today!"},{"location":"public/gpu/","title":"GPU","text":""},{"location":"public/gpu/#supported-gpu-architectures","title":"Supported GPU Architectures","text":"<ul> <li>Direct Passthrough (1 to 1 mapping) </li> <li>vGPU (1 to many mapping)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"public/gpu/#hardware-compatibility-list-tested","title":"Hardware Compatibility List (Tested)","text":"<ul> <li>NVIDIA</li> <li>vGPU Capabilities<ul> <li>Tesla</li> <li>A Series (A2 - A100)</li> <li>A6000</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To take advantage of vGPU functionality, the selected GPU must be compatible with one of the following NVIDIA GRID drivers 13.2, 13.10, 14.0, 15.2, 15.3, 16.0, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4 and 16.5.

This technique allows for reduced data usage between vm's, tenants, and backup/DR sites.</p> </li> <li> <p>Silent Corruption Detection &amp; Correction The vSAN stores a checksum of every block of data that is written to it. When that block is read, it is verified for integrity. This technique protects against silent corruption and bit rot. In the event of finding a bad block, our algorithm will check for redundant copies locally within the system. If that block cannot be found then DR/Backup sites will be checked in real time. If a good copy of the block exists at a remote site it will be retrieved and repaired seamlessly without user interaction or down time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized Remote Synchronization If the destination site receiving backups already contains (for example) 90% of the same blocks, then VergeIO knows to only send the 10% of differentiating blocks.

This allows a single sign-on experience for users as credentials from the defined authorization source can be appointed for users to log in to a VergeIO system.</p> <p></p> <p>Catalog A catalog is a group of related recipes. For example, one catalog may contain many varied Windows VM recipes, while another catalog in the same repository could contain all Linux-based VM recipes. Customers can group recipes into catalogs in whatever way makes sense for their particular organization.</p> <p></p> <p>Cloud (VergeIO Cloud) In VergeIO, \"cloud\" refers to each autonomous Virtual Data Center (VDC) created within a VergeIO system. This includes the VDC created at the base level (when VergeIO is installed on physical hardware) as well as the VDC that is created with each subsequent tenant and subtenant.</p> <p></p> <p>Cluster A cluster is a group of nodes (physical or virtual) with like hardware resources, used as a pool for storage, compute, or HCI functions. A single VergeIO system can contain a variety of different clusters to provide an array of performance/costing options. The resources of a single cluster can be divided up among multiple tenants and a single tenant can be given resources to multiple clusters within the same system.</p> <p></p> <p>Host Refers to the top-level Virtual Data Center(VDC), aka VergeIO cloud, which is created during the initial VergeIO install on the physical hardware. The Host has direct control over the hardware, whereas tenants/subtentants will have resources assigned to them, but no access to physical components.</p> <p></p> <p>Media Images Media Images are files uploaded to the VergeIO vSAN to make available inside the VergeIO environment. Common files uploaded are those used for installing new virtual machines (e.g. *.iso) or importing machines or drives from existing systems (e.g. *.ova, *.ovf, *.raw, *.qcow, *.vmdk, etc).</p> <p></p> <p>Nested Multi-Tenancy Nested Multi-Tenancy provides layers of tenancy; the host tenant can allocate any portion of its base resources to child tenants and those child tenants can then divide and apportion any of its resources down to its own child tenants, and so on.</p> <p></p> <p>Network (Core) The Core Network is a virtual network used to handle all intra-node communication. Every VergeIO cloud has 1 Core Network, which is created automatically during the VergeIO installation (on the Host) or at the point of tenant creation (for each tenant.)</p> <p></p> <p>Network (DMZ) The DMZ Network is a virtual network used to connect all other networks with the Core Network. Every VergeIO cloud has 1 DMZ Network, which is created automatically during the VergeIO installation (on the Host) or at the point of tenant creation (for each tenant.)</p> <p></p> <p>Network (External) An External Network is a network outside of the VergeIO system; any pre-existing network that will be interfaced with VergeIO (e.g. company LAN, direct WAN connections, Wi-Fi networks). In a VergeIO system, there is typically at least one External Network and there can be multiple External networks. External Networks can be defined during or after VergeIO system installation.</p> <p>Note: External does not necessarily indicate that the network is a direct Internet Connection (although it can be), but rather only External to the VergeIO system.</p> <p></p> <p>Network (Internal) An Internal Network is a virtual network originated within VergeIO. Any number of Internal Networks can be created. An Internal Network is created default-secure; with built-in VergeIO networking functionality allowing for opening up access between Internal Networks and to External Networks as needed.</p> <p></p> <p>Network (Maintenance) A Maintenance Network is an External network that can be created to handle IPMI access to Physical nodes and optional PXE boot.</p> <p></p> <p>Node (Physical) Physical nodes are actual hardware servers that host the base VergeIO cloud.</p> <p></p> <p>Node (Tenant) Tenant nodes are virtual servers that simulate physical nodes. Each tenant is assigned at least one tenant node and more tenant nodes can be added for scale and/or to accommodate clustering software such as Kubernetes, Hadoop, etc..</p> <p></p> <p>Recipe (VM) A VM recipe is a customizable template for launching new virtual machine instances. A VM recipe can include initial hardware specifications (e.g. number of cores, RAM, CPU type, drives, NICs, etc). and resource pool specification. Additionally, custom fields can be added to the recipe to gather input at the time of recipe consumption. This data, input by the recipe consumer, can then be utilized to adjust elements within the new VM guest OS; typically at first startup. For example, a recipe can be configured to prompt for a database username and password, or for disk/ram size settings to input into an application conf file. VergeIO VM recipes are compatible with Cloud-Init. See https://cloud-init.io for cloud-init documentation.</p> <p></p> <p>Recipe (Tenant) A tenant tecipe is a customizable template for creating a new tenant instance. A tenant recipe can include predefined settings for configuration/resource allocation and can include custom fields to gather input at the time of recipe consumption in order to adjust elements of the resulting tenant instance.</p> <p></p> <p>Recipe Consumer The recipe consumer is the vergeIO user creating a new tenant or VM instance using a recipe.</p> <p></p> <p>Repair Server A repair server provides a potential reconstruction mechanism for a system that experienced a problem extending beyond its redundancy tolerance (e.g. simultaneous, multiple drive failures spanning multiple nodes). Typically, a repair server is a sync destination that contains a fairly recent replication of the given system. A repair server will automatically attempt to pull back any needed blocks from the remote system, potentially avoiding the need to roll back using a snapshot. It is generally recommended to have a repair server in place whenever possible.</p> <p></p> <p>Repository A repository is a site collection of recipe catalogs. Typically, a tenant has access to a repository provided by its VergeIO service provider. Each tenant can also create a local repository to store its own recipe catalogs.</p> <p>The vergeIO Repository is also included by default on a VergeIO Installation. The VergeIO Repository includes the standard NAS Service VM.</p> <p></p> <p>Site A site is a VergeIO system with its own physical hardware. Typically VergeIO sites are separated by geographical location. Multiple sites can be synchronized to allow for robust disaster recovery/business continuity options.</p> <p></p> <p>Sites Dashboard The Sites Dashboard provides a central page for monitoring and administering multiple systems.  Top-level statistics from included locations are aggregated to a single screen, with drill-down options to access individual sites and view more detailed information.  </p> <p></p> <p>Snapshot A snapshot captures the state of an entity at a particular point in time. Snapshots can be used to create point-in-time capture of an entire VergeIO cloud, tenant, an individual virtual machine, or a NAS volume. Snapshots allow \"rolling back\" a system, which can be helpful for recovery, development, and testing purposes.</p> <p></p> <p>Snapshot Profile A snapshot profile defines a schedule for snapshot creation and cleanup.</p> <p></p> <p>Storage Tier A Storage Tier is a pool of storage with equivalent underlying physical storage devices. Storage Tiering is a feature built into the VergeIO vSAN, allowing splitting data between different types of physical media based on requirements for performance, accessibility, capacity, and cost. Storage tiering can dramatically reduce costs by taking better advantage of more expensive disks where most needed while using less expensive (e.g. spinning disk) for cold storage, like archives, etc. See vSAN Tiers for a description of standard Storage Tiers.</p> <p></p> <p>Subscriptions Subscriptions allow for monitoring a system (or components of a system) by defining system information to send to users via Email.</p> <ul> <li>Subscriptions with the On Demand type send alerts triggered by warnings, errors, or thresholds.</li> <li>Subscriptions with the Scheduled type send reporting information at regularly scheduled intervals (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly, etc).</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Subscription Profiles Subscription profiles define the aspects of a subscription (on Demand/Scheduled, trigger criteria/schedule). Many subscription profiles are pre-loaded by default with the VergeIO Install. Additional subscription profiles can also be created.</p> <p></p> <p>Tenant A tenant is a complete and separate Virtual Data Center, running its own instance of the VergeIO OS. Child tenants are apportioned from a parent VergeIO cloud. The nested, multi-tenancy infrastructure allows each VergeIO cloud to subdivide any portion of its resources to provide multiple, sub-divisions of resources. Each tenant is a complete VergeIO cloud with its own storage, networking, and security. Tenants are isolated from each other, with each autonomously managed. This provides the mechanism for service providers or IT departments to allocate and administer resources dynamically, keeping autonomous units for different customers/business groups.</p> <p></p> <p>VergeOS The VergeIO Operating System (Verge OS) is a complete operating system specifically designed for rapidly deployed, complete virtual data centers, with nested tenancy functionality. Verge OS is installed/run directly on base hardware as well as within virtual nodes (used for tenants).</p> <p></p> <p>vGPU A vGPU is a physical GPU installed on a host node that is dissected into multiple virtual GPUs. vGPU provides access to multiple VMs simultaneously from a single piece of GPU hardware.</p> <p></p> <p>Volume A Volume is a directory structure/collection of files within a VergeIO NAS. A VergeIO NAS can contain one or more Volumes, with each individual Volume allowing different settings for aspects such as security, snapshot, tiering, max size, Anti-Virus settings, shares, etc.</p> <ul> <li>Remote Volume - mounts a pre-existing (external) NFS or CIFS file system to make it accessible within a VergeIO system.</li> <li>Local Volume - stored within the VergeIO vSAN</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Need more Help?
